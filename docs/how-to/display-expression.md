You have any text you want to appear as description of a clicked feature?
In the example below, you can see we used the beekeeper and the bee species.

## Layer properties

To edit the display expression, go to `layer Properties --> Display`.

!![display-properties](../assets/images/display-properties.png)

The expression used will be what we see when we click on features.
