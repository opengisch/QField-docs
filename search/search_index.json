In other words, only the relevant parts of a task are accessible on the interface, while less important things remain out of sight.</p> <p>Before heading out to the field though, preliminary steps such as layer styling, tailored forms, input validation, or any other project configurations should first be done on the desktop via QGIS.</p>"},{"location":"get-started/concepts/#compatibility-with-qgis","title":"Compatibility with QGIS","text":"<p>Since QField is a mobile optimized version of the QGIS desktop app, your project will appear and feel identical both in QGIS and QField.

You can find the technical details on the different job types in the technical documentation section. In simple words, there exist three different synchronization activities:</p> <ul> <li>From QGIS to QFieldCloud: This synchronization process uploads a complete new \"project package\" and replaces the existing one stored in the cloud. If you are working with GeoPackages it is important to note, that the existing GeoPackage on the cloud will be replaced with the one you have just uploaded.</li> <li>From QFieldCloud to QField: If you want to download the uploaded \"project package\" to your mobile device, QFieldCloud \"packages\" the project into a specific format that is saved in the internal application folder structure. Important to know here is that in case you are working with PostgreSQL databases and have chosen the working mode offline editing then a local GeoPackage of the data will be created in the corresponding folder (make sure to configure your secret properly), unless a direct connection is needed.</li> <li>From QField to QFieldCLoud: Once you are done with collecting data, you can choose among two different synchronization options. The changes made are being applied as so-called deltas. Deltas reflect only the changes made to the different attributes. When pushing to or synchronizing with QFieldCloud, it is only the deltas that are being applied. Unlike in the synchronization process from QGIS to QFieldCloud, the whole GeoPackage is NOT replaced.</li> </ul> <p> Simple Synchronization Overview </p> <p>Tip</p> <p>There are a few tips, which we recommend to follow in order to avoid synchronization issues or overwritten data.</p> <ol> <li>Do not modify the QGIS project while personnel is working simultaneously in QField. If you synchronize your Desktop version to the cloud, QFieldCloud will overwrite the files. Although there may have been changes applied in QFieldCloud, QFieldSync will not show this by default. If you must work parallel on Desktop, make sure to check the QFieldCloud status and download the most recent data before uploading new files versions from your Desktop.</li> <li>Do not change the data structure before synchronizing the latest field edits. Often, officers work in QGIS and adapt the data structure of the project files, which leads to errors if the changes from QField have not yet been pushed to QFieldCloud.</li> <li>Use uuid's as primary keys, especially when working with relations and in teams. Synchronization often occur due to the lack of adding primary keys to your datasets. Especially, when working with relationships and in teams, if the data were not configured with an according primary key, it may happen that data loss occurs because of simultaneous editing of the data.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"get-started/tutorials/advanced-setup-qfc/#working-modes","title":"Working Modes","text":"<p>When configuring a project for QField you can choose between the different \"Packaging\" options.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Offline editing: Regardless of whether your files are stored in a GeoPackage, database or other format, QFieldCloud will create a temporary GeoPackage of all the project data. Changes made to this GeoPackage will not be available to others. Once the changes are synchronized or pushed back to QFieldCloud, the made changes only will be applied to the existing file on QFieldCloud. We recommend to use this option to avoid unnecessary data losses in case of lost data connection.</p> </li> <li> <p>Direct Data Access: When using <code>direct database access</code>, QFieldCloud will directly edit data in the PostGIS database. This will only work with a reliable internet connection in the field, but has the advantage that all data is directly visible to all users and allows to use any PostGIS specific setup (triggers, generated fields, etc).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Changes will only be visible to users once the Synchronization via QFieldCloud has been applied on the different devices.

This will only work with a reliable internet connection in the field, but has the advantage that all data is directly visible to all users and allows to use any PostGIS specific setup (triggers, generated fields, etc).</p> <p>Note</p> <p>When using <code>offline editing</code>, QField will work on a local copy of the database in a GeoPackage, which will be synced by QFieldCloud to the original database once synchronized by the user. We recommend to use this option to avoid unnecessary data losses in case of lost data connection.</p> <p>Changes will only be visible to users once the Synchronisation via QFieldCloud has been applied on the different devices. When a local copy is created, advanced PostGIS operations (like triggers) will not be available on QField.</p> <p>You can find more information on QFieldCloud technical reference.</p>"},{"location":"get-started/tutorials/advanced-setup-qfc/#project-configuration-best-practices","title":"Project Configuration Best Practices","text":"<p>To ensure a smooth synchronization process between QGIS, QField and QFieldCloud, follow these recommendations.</p> <p>1. Centralized Data Storage - Add all data in the same folder as your .qgs project file</p> <p>Before uploading your project, ensure all relevant data sources (GeoPackages, rasters, etc.) are located in the same directory as your project file (<code>.qgs/.qgz</code>) or in a subdirectory (e.g., <code>./data</code>, <code>./assets</code>). If files are spread across different drives or folders on your computer, QFieldSync and QFieldCloud may fail to package them correctly for the mobile device.</p> <p>2. Managing Unique IDs - Add a unique ID to your layers</p> <p>When multiple users collect data offline simultaneously, standard auto-incrementing IDs (1, 2, 3...) will result in conflict errors when applying the deltas changes data on QFieldCloud.</p> <ul> <li>For Relations: Create a specific text field (e.g., <code>survey_uuid</code>) and use <code>uuid()</code> or <code>uuid('WithoutBraces')</code> as the default value. Use this field for all foreign keys and for primary key if the layer is from PostgreSQL/PostGIS.</li> <li>For the <code>fid</code> (Feature ID): If you are working with GeoPackages, you can reduce conflicts on the internal <code>fid</code> integer column by setting the \"Default Value\" to the expression <code>epoch(now())</code>. This generates a unique integer based on the current timestamp.</li> </ul> <p>Tip</p> <p>To set this up, go to Layer Properties &gt; Attributes Form, select the <code>fid</code> field, and set the Default Value to: </p><pre><code>epoch(now())\n</code></pre> Ensure the \"Apply default value on update\" box is unchecked so the ID remains constant after creation.  <p>3. Relative Paths - Ensure that all attachment paths are relative</p> <p>Absolute paths (e.g., <code>C:\\Users\\{username}\\Downloads\\photo_001.jpg</code>) will break when the project is transferred to a mobile device (Android/iOS), as the file system structure is different.</p> <p>Workflow</p> <ol> <li>Navigate to Project &gt; Properties... &gt; General.</li> <li>Set Save paths to <code>Relative</code>.</li> </ol> <p>4. Stable Layer References in Expressions - Use the Layer Name in expressions, not the Layer ID</p> <p>When writing expressions (for example, inside <code>aggregate()</code> or <code>relation_aggregate()</code>) functions, QGIS allows you to reference layers by their internal ID (e.g., <code>places_2348274...</code>) or their Name (e.g., <code>Places</code>). Always use the Layer Name (e.g., <code>Places</code>).</p> <p>Why? The internal Layer ID changes if you remove and re-add a layer or internally in QFieldCloud when a packaging job is triggered could change, which breaks your expressions. The Layer Name remains stable as long as you do not rename it in the layer tree.</p> <p>5. Preferred File Formats - Convert your layers to GeoPackage</p> <p>QField and QFieldCloud are optimized for the GeoPackage (.gpkg) format. While QField and QFieldCloud support others formats like Shapefiles (<code>.shp</code>), GeoJSON, and KML, etc., is strongly recommend converting these layers to GeoPackage before starting your project.</p> <p>How to Convert to GeoPackage?</p> <p>Workflow</p> <ol> <li>In QGIS, right-click your layer in the layer tree.</li> <li>Select Export &gt; Save Features As...</li> <li>Set Format to <code>GeoPackage</code></li> <li>In File name, click <code>...</code> and navigate to your project folder. Give the new database a name (e.g., notes_points.gpkg`)</li> <li>In Layer name, give your layer a simple name (e.g., <code>notes_points</code>)</li> <li>Click OK</li> <li>The new layer will load into your project. You can now remove the old layer</li> </ol> <p>6. Modular File Structure - Store one layer per GeoPackage</p> <p>QFieldCloud manages versions and backups at the file level. Every time changes are synchronized, a backup of the modified file is created.</p> <ul> <li>The Risk: If you store multiple layers in a single GeoPackage (e.g., <code>survey_data.gpkg</code> containing Trees, Roads, and Buildings), restoring a backup to fix an error in the Trees layer will also roll back valid work done on Roads and Buildings during that same period.</li> <li>The Solution: Save each layer in its own separate GeoPackage (e.g., <code>trees.gpkg</code>, <code>roads.gpkg</code>).     This allows you to restore a previous version of one specific layer without losing data in others.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"get-started/tutorials/advanced-setup-qfc/#common-configuration-errors","title":"Common Configuration Errors","text":"<p>If you are experiencing synchronization issues, check for these common configuration errors:</p> Issue Cause Solution Missing Images Paths are set to \"Absolute\" Go to Project Properties and set paths to \"Relative\".

These conversions are achieved via \"Layer Actions\". Under the project configuration dialog you can set the required \"Action\" for each layer. An action defines whether QFS should \"track\" the changes made to your layer, directly access it (in the case of a WMS or Postgres layer) or whether it should treat it as a read-only layer.</p> <p> Configure the project layers </p> <p>Depending on the layer type, different types of actions are available:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Copy (only available for file-based layers (eg. Gpkg, Shp, Tiff)): The layer will be copied to the packaged project folder but not be tracked. A new copy in the packaged project folder will be made. Note: In case that you have multiple layers within one GeoPackage, all layers will be uploaded despite only one of them being present in the QGIS project. It is recommended to have one layer per Gpkg unless strictly necessary. Refer to common best practices for additional tips</p> </li> <li> <p>Keep existing (copy if missing): The layer source will be left untouched. In the case of a long-term project, where synchronization is frequently happening, it is advisable to use this option to not re-package the file every time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Offline editing: The layer is copied into the packaged project folder. This layer is traced and the changes made are recorded in a changelog, which QFS will use later for the synchronization. When synchronizing the changes back, this log will be replaced and all changes also be applied to the original source layer. This allows you to keep track of the changes and also to work with multiple users. Note: There is no conflict handling in place.</p> </li> <li> <p>Directly access data source: (non-file-based only) The data will directly be accessed. This option is only available for online data such as WMS/WFS or Postgres layers.

The Setup</p> <ul> <li>Generic Connection User (<code>qfield_admin</code>): You create one database role that handles the actual password/SSL connection.   This role should have the necessary <code>USAGE</code> or <code>CONNECT</code> privileges and crucially must be a member of the specific user roles in PostgreSQL/PostGIS.</li> <li>Specific User Roles (<code>user_mielena</code>, <code>ninja_user_001</code>): You can create roles for your actual users without passwords.

Working with QField in an Archaeological Survey and Archaeological Risk Assessment Projects","text":"<p>Until recently, paper maps were the only way of recording archaeological features and the fields\u2019 visibility in an archaeological survey work. Such data were digitised into a CAD or GIS software creating the individual site sheets separately on a simple digital document afterwards.</p> <p>Today, QField, thanks to its compatibility with QGIS, allows you to skip the transition from paper to digital or from different software, reducing time and costs.</p> <p>The archaeological survey (for a comprehensive account of methods of the Archaeological survey, see Cambi, Terrenato 1994, pp. 117\u2013143, and Renfrew, Bahn 2016 [1,2]) must be preceded by the construction of a GIS platform that takes into consideration both the data acquired during the field survey phase and the bibliographic ones. For this reason, it will be necessary to work on two tables:</p> <ul> <li>One is spatial, which is useful in the field.</li> <li>The other is alphanumeric.</li> </ul> <p>Both will be joined in a single spatial table, useful for consultation on the GIS desktop. This process is possible through the use of a relational geo-database such as SpatiaLite and PostGIS or, alternatively, through the creation of a join between the tables and the geometries.</p> <p>However, the big advantage of using a geo-database is the ability to create queries capable of merging information from two or more tables into a single table (view) (for more in-depth information on the use of GIS and Geodatabases in archaeology, see Fronza, Nardini, Valenti 2009 [3]).</p> <p>This process further speeds up field work by minimising the data to be stored during archaeological survey.</p> <p>The data collected in the field during the survey will be recorded and digitised through three different layers (point, line and polygon). The attribute tables connected to the three layers record the following information: Project Name (String), Municipality (String), Location (String), Feature Number (Integer), Place Name (String), Location (String), Date (Date), Site Definition (String), Visibility (String) and Photos (String).</p> <p>The attribute values, \u201cProject name\u201d and \u201cFeature Number\u201d, between the two tables must be Unique Constraint in order to identify only one unique \u201cProject name\u201d and only one \u201cFeature Number\u201d.</p> <p>The GIS platform must also have base maps such as Google Satellite, Open Street Map, Orthophotos and so on. In this case, we used the following maps: Carta Tecnica Regionale (1:10.000), Open Street Map e Google Satellite. To make these maps lighter, we created first overviews (pyramids) in QGIS.</p> <p>The positioning of the archaeological features identified can be recorded through the GPS internal device. However, for a greater accuracy, QField can be connected to a GNSS antenna.</p> <p>In archaeological consultancy and archaeological risk assessment jobs, it is recommended to upload into the GIS project an infrastructure layer containing the infrastructure\u2019s geometric information, measurements and others, besides a buffer of itself.</p> <p>After setting the basics of our project on QGIS, we need to export the  project through the use of the QFieldSync plugin within QField. Alternatively, we can carry this out by simply copying the folder containing the project file with the *. QGIS extension, the database and the rasters (or the GeoPackage containing our rasters: IGM, Basemap and so on) into our smartphone or tablet.</p> <p>By default, QField creates a folder where you can save projects (Android/data/ ch.opengis.QField/files), but it is always better to store them on an external SSD, since if you were to uninstall QField from your device, all the folders and files contained in them will be removed running the risk of deleting the data.</p> <p>After we set up the bases of the GIS project in QGIS, we need to export it into QField through a suitable plug-in called QField-Sync.</p> <p>However, we can perform that task even by simply transferring (copy and paste) the QGIS project and the related dataset to our Android device. The QGIS project must be saved as .QGIS.</p>"},{"location":"success-stories/heritage-impact-assessment/#4-benefits-and-drawbacks-of-using-qfield-in-an-archaeological-survey-and-archaeological-risk-assessment-jobs","title":"4. Benefits and Drawbacks of Using QField in an Archaeological Survey and Archaeological Risk Assessment Jobs","text":"<p>QField, similar to all the cutting-edge tools, has some limits related the the use of the devices; the main one of these might be caused by the poor bandwidth or lack of internet.

At the same time, we would not to be able to upload WMS services such as Google Satellite, Open Street Map and others. Another disadvantage is related to the battery life: keeping the screen, data connection and GPS always active will drastically reduce the battery life of our device, even if we might bring with us portable powerbanks. On the other hand, the benefits of using QField are a lot; in fact, it allows us to reduce many procedures we were to carry out had we registered the archaeological features identified during the survey on a paper map or had we filled up their related information manually on paper sheets. Furthermore, another benefit constitutes the possibility of using QField for integrating the device camera or a GNSS antenna. All of this makes the collection of data easier and increases their accuracy while at the same time reducing time, costs and workforce.</p> <p>G.G.</p>"},{"location":"success-stories/heritage-impact-assessment/#5-working-with-qfield-in-an-open-area-excavation","title":"5. Working with QField in an Open Area Excavation","text":"<p>In  an  open  area  excavation  scenario,  the  advantages  and  convenience  of  using  an App  such  as  QField  are  innumerable.  This  is  true  especially  in  commercial  archaeology sites, where very often the deadlines to carry out the work and the budgets available for the archaeological investigation are very tight. This forces you to work with the maximum optimisation of the timing and assets, despite the fact that the weather and visibility conditions in the field are often poor (Figure 2).</p> <p> Figure 2 - An example of when the weather and visibility conditions in the field are poor. Image by Roberto Montagnetti 2019. </p> <p>Now, let us see why the use of QField facilitates the reduction of working times and, at the same time, guarantees the saving of resources to be invested in the archaeological investigation, providing a practical example of using the GIS App for Android.</p> <p>In this kind of work, the first step is to strip the area to be investigated with the use of machinery, aiming to remove the topsoil and then eventually the subsoil.</p> <p>The subsequent step involves the identification of archaeological features both directly in the field and by comparing the results of the aerial remote sensing and geophysical analysis when this type of technology is used.</p> <p>The archaeological features identified are then digitally detected by GPS or Total Station.</p> <p>Finally, all the excavation interventions that need to be completed in the investigation area (slots) are outlined, where it is more relevant in terms of understanding the stratigraphic relationship between the archaeological features identified.</p> <p>This phase of the work is called \u201cPre-Ex\u201d.</p> <p>The Pre-Ex survey will be the topographical base for the creation of the GIS platform of the project in QGIS, together with the base map of the area, the TBM\u2019s and any aerial orthophotos of the site. Within the same platform, we will also upload a geodatabase containing the layers necessary for the digitisation of the following:</p> <p>a. The archaeological features identified in the field;</p> <p>b The slots planned;</p> <p>c. The contexts investigated and their related levels;</p> <p>d. The plan and section lines used for the manual drawings;</p> <p>e. All the elements that we may need to detect during the archaeological investigation of the site.</p> <p>However, in the same database, there will also be tables related to the paperwork sheets.</p> <p>Thus, they are comparable to the digital version of the paper registers and other related paperwork that are commonly used on construction sites for excavation documentation.</p> <p>This database (what comes next is just an example of database structure. Tables and geometries can be different according to the characteristics of the sites and the topology of investigations that must be carried out. In any case, tables and vectors must be related to each other in order to interact. QField recognises the project relations set in QGIS.) is made of:</p> <ol> <li>Sites (Vector): Contains the list and description of all the sites on which the company is working.</li> <li>Context_Layer (Vector): This layer graphically represents all the contexts identified and excavated during the excavation project.</li> <li>Slots (Vector): This layer graphically represents all the slots excavated and contains the information of the paper slot register.</li> <li>Level_Layer (Vector): This layer graphically represents all the levels taken during the excavation of each slot.</li> <li>Drawings_Vector (Vector): This layer graphically represents the plan and section lines used for the manual drawings.</li> <li>Drawing_Point (Vector): This layer graphically represents the points through which the plan and section lines pass.</li> <li>Context_Register (No geometry): digital register, which contains all the investigated contexts.</li> <li>Drawings_Register (No geometry): digital register of all the drawings.</li> <li>Permatrace_Register (No geometry): digital register of the permatrace sheets.</li> <li>Sample_Register (No geometry): digital register of the samples collected.</li> <li>Photo_Register (No geometry): digital register of all photos taken.</li> <li>Small_Find_Register (No geometry): digital register of all small finds collected.</li> <li>Finds_Bag_Register (No geometry): digital register of all finds bags collected during the excavation.</li> <li>Context_Sheets (No geometry): This layer is the digital version of the context sheets register and contains all the information related to each context investigated.</li> </ol> <p>At this point, we need to simply transfer the master project created in QGIS with all the \u201cproject relation\u201d and \u201cwidgets\u201d to the tablet or the smartphone and manage it directly on site with QField to immediately appreciate its advantages and convenience (Figure 3).</p> <p> Figure 3 - An example of the same open area excavation GIS platform project in QGIS (above) and in QField (below). Image by Roberto Montagnetti 2019. </p> <p>In fact, primarily, by using this system, archaeologists who are working in the field will be able to directly register the context numbers identified during the excavation within QField, in the appropriate \u201ccontext register\u201d table in the QField database.</p> <p>This aspect already speeds up on-site operations by saving the time generally taken to go back and forth from the site to the compound or from the site to the car/van and vice versa, for the compilation of paper registers; especially, if we take into consideration the fact that, on a regular basis, cars and compounds are located at a considerable distance away from the excavation area.</p> <p>Additionally, since generally there is only one device on site and this is usually held by the site manager or by the supervisors, this would make it easier for them to check that the field archaeologists are assigning the right numbers to the identified contexts.</p> <p>Very often, on a location tend to become confused, especially when the excavation area of the site is poor due to adverse weather conditions. Along with the above issues, they can also encounter errors such as registering the same feature with different cut numbers or by assigning the same context numbers to different features.</p> <p>This occurs even more frequently when the field team is composed of numerous archaeologists who work in separate excavation slots from each other. These slots can be spread around the excavation area, making interaction and communication between them more challenging.</p> <p>This issue is also linked to another problem, which means, for those who work in the field, it is impossible to have a constant overview of the investigation area and the archaeological features identified, which often causes confusion and making mistakes during the registration of the context numbers.</p> <p>Therefore, from this point of view, QField represents a real breakthrough by giving the following possibilities to the people working on site, at any time:</p> <p>i. To have a general overview of the excavation area;</p> <p>ii. To query the surveyed archaeological features;</p> <p>iii. To check the shape and the orientation of the archaeological features identified in the Pre-Ex phase, which must be dug even when the site conditions are poor.</p> <p>QField aids with various challenges encountered in the field: time wasted due to inclement, wet weather and perpetually sodden and muddy soil churned up by people and vehicles continually accessing the site. These cause the identified archaeological features to become unrecognisable after several days of the site being stripped (Figure 2).</p> <p>By using the device\u2019s GPS, as it allows the user to navigate within the excavation area and to find, albeit with a certain margin of error, the archaeological features that need to be excavated, even when the visibility on site is poor.</p> <p>Similarly, by doing so, when visibility conditions are bad, it is easier to centre with the slots in the archaeological features that have previously been identified in the Pre-Ex phase, which prevents the miscalculation of digging into the natural sites.</p> <p>A typical example of this is when there are furrows running across the field, and it becomes increasingly difficult to see their entire length with the naked eye.</p> <p>Typically, in order to remedy this type of problem, archaeologists use printed maps in the excavation area; however, although this can certainly be a help, in practice, they are in no way comparable to the convenience of digital maps and consequently to QField for a number of reasons:</p> <ol> <li>Printed maps deteriorate very quickly due to wind, humidity and especially when handled by human hands.</li> <li>To contain the entire excavation area, they must often be printed in very large formats, which requires particular plotters, which incurs considerable costs and makes them difficult to use.</li> <li>Paper maps are not interactive, which means that you cannot ask them questions.</li> <li>They do not solve the problem of having to precisely centre the archaeological features, which need to be investigated with the slots when the visibility conditions on the site are poor.</li> </ol> <p>Notably, the use of QField on site simplifies the workload of managers and supervisors in the planning of the excavation interventions, allowing them to easily instruct field archaeologists directly in the excavation area. By doing so, they will be able to train the field team efficiently with accurate information regarding the features that they will have to dig, supporting their explanation with the graphic aid of the tablet and with details related to what has already been investigated and uploaded into the database of the project.</p> <p>Apart from the fieldwork, QField makes the job easier for archaeologists even in the recording phase, simplifying their work in the production of the paperwork. As we already mentioned, they can continuously query the tablet to obtain the necessary information that needs to be included in their paper documentation sheets, such as the section or plan numbers of the contexts that they have excavated, along with the photo numbers of the same contexts, or any other related information.</p> <p>Furthermore, it will be much easier for them to draw the location plans that are generally required in the context sheets, as they will have much more pieces of information available to provide an interpretation of what they have dug.</p> <p>Another very important aspect to take into consideration when working with QField is that there is a possibility of completely removing the manual registration process of the slot numbers, context numbers, drawing numbers, sample numbers, photo numbers and so on. Simultaneously, by using this system, we can also avoid issues such as:</p> <ol> <li>The manual data-entry of the paper registers into the database of the project;</li> <li>The problem of deciphering incomprehensible calligraphies, which greatly increase the possibility of making transcription mistakes.</li> </ol> <p>In fact, unclear calligraphies are a recurring problem related to the manual recording of the excavation documentation and in particular of the registers. This is also going to affect the accuracy of the information that must be put into the database during computerisation.</p> <p>Additionally, the archaeologist involved in the paperwork must include in his documentation context numbers, drawing numbers and other types of information related to the archaeological features and in relation to his own, which have been excavated and recorded by other colleagues. In this circumstance, to confuse one number for another, perhaps due to the unclear handwriting of the colleague, is a very common mistake.</p> <p>Worst-case scenario means that:</p> <ol> <li>There will no longer be a match between digital registers of the database and paper registers;</li> <li>The information on various context sheets will not be reliable;</li> <li>Both cases (as mentioned above).</li> </ol> <p>Therefore, we will have to spend a lot of time and effort tracking down the error and correcting it.</p> <p>Instead, the use of a digital recording eliminates this problem and facilitates the checking of errors.</p> <p>The main benefit of the GIS tools is that they enable us to query the features by giving us the possibility to cross-check data, which speeds up the checking process.</p> <p>To give a practical example, if you need to adjust the number of a context, or a drawing or anything else within a digital register by a number, with the QGIS \u201cfield calculator\u201d, it becomes an easy task taking only a few seconds.</p> <p>Just think how long it would take to perform the same task using registers and paperonly documentation, especially when working with considerable amounts of data collected within an extensive excavation.</p> <p>In this case, you must first trace the folder containing the numerical series of the number to be revised, then browse one-by-one all the registers until you find the number that needs to be amended and finally corrected, along with all the subsequent numbers. This will not only need to be corrected in the registers, but also within the specific sections of the context sheets.</p> <p>In other words, if a context, drawing or photo number has been registered incorrectly, it is not enough to correct only the register but also all the paperwork that relates to the number that has been mentioned.</p> <p>Therefore, by using a digital register (table), the operation will only take a few minutes; however, if you were working on the paper documentation by hand, it could take numerous hours of hard work.</p> <p>One final significantly important aspect to take into consideration is the saving of paper and consequently the amount of money involved. The use of QField and digital documentation allows us to efficiently manage the excavation data. By working in this way, it is no longer necessary to print out the survey plans, the registers and the paperwork sheets.</p> <p>However, if the competent authority (county archaeology) or the customer explicitly requests a paper version of all the documentation produced on site, it will be possible to print out everything at the end of the project, only once all of the amendments have been made. This helps to avoid unnecessary waste of paper, along with all the other problems that were previously mentioned.</p> <p>Even in this case, the QGIS \u201cprint composer\u201d allows us to develop customised layouts that can be saved and used at any time.</p>"},{"location":"success-stories/heritage-impact-assessment/#6-conclusions","title":"6. Conclusions","text":"<p>In an increasingly digital world, it is unacceptable to continue working on paper especially because, at the end of the process, all paper documentation must be digitised for archiving needs. Today, in fact, both the museums and the warehouses of the archaeological companies have less space available for the storage of paper folders. At this point, it would be beneficial to manage the data in a digital format at the beginning of the excavation process, immediately saving time and resources.</p> <p>Scanning the PDF documents of registers, context sheets and, in general, all documentation produced on site is not a practical and sustainable solution. As previously mentioned, often, this documentation in extensive excavation projects is made up of thousands of paperwork sheets; I challenge anyone to reconstruct an excavation matrix by checking all the stratigraphic reports on the paperwork PDF scan. This kind of job forces you to continually scroll up and down the PDF document in search of the relationships between the various contexts, resulting in a significant waste of time and energy; without any regards to the costs that are involved when scanning in thousands of sheets.</p> <p>Archaeological excavations are constantly driven by strict and increasingly shorter deadlines. The use of GIS for the management of excavation data can no longer be ignored. Currently, the possibility of an \u201cOpen Source\u201d and a \u201cpocket\u201d GIS platform, such as QField, truly represents a unique opportunity to make the work of archaeologists on site easier, faster and more accurate.</p> <p>As previously mentioned, it is much easier to build the matrix and compile the phasing of the archaeological features identified working with a digital system during the Post-Ex phase. Thus, only an instrument such as GIS, which gives us the possibility of launching queries and continuously cross-referencing data, allows us to perform this type of work quickly and efficiently.</p> <p>At the same time, the GIS allows us to have a continuous overview of the data produced on site and to further implement information regarding the investigation by using geospatial analysis, which helps to facilitate the final interpretative reconstruction.</p> <p>In short, the principle of paper lasting forever cannot be accepted any more. Primarily, because it is not true, and secondly, it deteriorates over time, especially when, as in most cases, it is kept in the basements of archives, museums or sites of archaeological companies.</p> <p>In addition, paper documents entail enormous logistical difficulties in terms of sharing and consulting data, in comparison to digital documentation, which can be easily shared.</p> <p>R.M.</p> <p>Institutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.</p> <p>Informed Consent Statement: Not applicable.</p> <p>References</p> <ol> <li>Cambi, F.; Terrenato, N.

The purpose of the survey was to map the extent of vanilla plantations and obtain estimates of the numbers of vanilla plants, area under vanilla cultivation, and the proportion of plantations that were managed or neglected. This information is being used by MAFF on Vava'u for agricultural planning and decision making.</p> <p>Extension officers were trained to use QField at MAFF's trial plantation. Following training, a team of seven extension officers conducted the survey of vanilla plantations. In total, 140 vanilla plantations were surveyed. The survey data was processed and visualised using QGIS and a Shiny dashboard application. QField enabled MAFF staff to view reference layers of farm boundaries on mobile devices in the field and map the extent of vanilla plantations within each farm. Maps of the vanilla plantations and summary statistics reporting the number of vanilla plantations, total area surveyed, and the estimated yield for plantations were produced.</p> <p>Capturing this information using QField enabled MAFF to identify that large areas under vanilla cultivation were in a neglected management condition. This data, and the insights generated from it, were used for reporting at the national level and presentations to senior ministry staff at the MAFF headquarters on Tongatapu in July 2020. Following the vanilla survey, there are plans to train MAFF extension staff based on the main island (Tongatapu) and other island groups to use QField for crop and farm surveys. The MAFF team in Vava'u are currently using QField to map areas cultivated by grower groups, the different crops under cultivation, and problems farmers are facing with cultivation in all districts on the island.

These conversions are achieved via \"Layer Actions\". Under the project configuration dialog you can set the required \"Action\" for each layer.

Gpkg, Shp, Tiff)): The layer will be copied to the packaged project folder but not be tracked. A new copy in the packaged project folder will be made. Note: In case that you have multiple layers within one GeoPackage, all layers will be uploaded despite only one of them being present in the QGIS project. It is recommended to have one layer per Gpkg unless strictly necessary. Refer to common best practices for additional tips</p> </li> <li> <p>Keep existing (copy if missing): The layer source will be left untouched. In the case of a long-term project, where synchronization is frequently happening, it is advisable to use this option to not re-package the file every time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Offline editing: The layer is copied into the packaged project folder. This layer is traced and the changes made are recorded in a changelog, which QFS will use later for the synchronization. When synchronizing the changes back, this log will be replaced and all changes also be applied to the original source layer. This allows you to keep track of the changes and also to work with multiple users. Note: There is no conflict handling in place.</p> </li> <li> <p>Directly access data source: (non-file-based only) The data will directly be accessed. This option is only available for online data such as WMS/WFS or Postgres layers.

Lavorare con QField in un'Indagine Archeologica e in Progetti di Valutazione del Rischio Archeologico","text":"<p>Until recently, paper maps were the only way of recording archaeological features and the fields\u2019 visibility in an archaeological survey work. Such data were digitised into a CAD or GIS software creating the individual site sheets separately on a simple digital document afterwards.</p> <p>Today, QField, thanks to its compatibility with QGIS, allows you to skip the transition from paper to digital or from different software, reducing time and costs.</p> <p>The archaeological survey (for a comprehensive account of methods of the Archaeological survey, see Cambi, Terrenato 1994, pp. 117\u2013143, and Renfrew, Bahn 2016 [1,2]) must be preceded by the construction of a GIS platform that takes into consideration both the data acquired during the field survey phase and the bibliographic ones. For this reason, it will be necessary to work on two tables:</p> <ul> <li>One is spatial, which is useful in the field.</li> <li>The other is alphanumeric.</li> </ul> <p>Both will be joined in a single spatial table, useful for consultation on the GIS desktop. This process is possible through the use of a relational geo-database such as SpatiaLite and PostGIS or, alternatively, through the creation of a join between the tables and the geometries.</p> <p>However, the big advantage of using a geo-database is the ability to create queries capable of merging information from two or more tables into a single table (view) (for more in-depth information on the use of GIS and Geodatabases in archaeology, see Fronza, Nardini, Valenti 2009 [3]).</p> <p>This process further speeds up field work by minimising the data to be stored during archaeological survey.</p> <p>The data collected in the field during the survey will be recorded and digitised through three different layers (point, line and polygon). The attribute tables connected to the three layers record the following information: Project Name (String), Municipality (String), Location (String), Feature Number (Integer), Place Name (String), Location (String), Date (Date), Site Definition (String), Visibility (String) and Photos (String).</p> <p>The attribute values, \u201cProject name\u201d and \u201cFeature Number\u201d, between the two tables must be Unique Constraint in order to identify only one unique \u201cProject name\u201d and only one \u201cFeature Number\u201d.</p> <p>The GIS platform must also have base maps such as Google Satellite, Open Street Map, Orthophotos and so on. In this case, we used the following maps: Carta Tecnica Regionale (1:10.000), Open Street Map e Google Satellite. To make these maps lighter, we created first overviews (pyramids) in QGIS.</p> <p>The positioning of the archaeological features identified can be recorded through the GPS internal device. However, for a greater accuracy, QField can be connected to a GNSS antenna.</p> <p>In archaeological consultancy and archaeological risk assessment jobs, it is recommended to upload into the GIS project an infrastructure layer containing the infrastructure\u2019s geometric information, measurements and others, besides a buffer of itself.</p> <p>After setting the basics of our project on QGIS, we need to export the  project through the use of the QFieldSync plugin within QField. Alternatively, we can carry this out by simply copying the folder containing the project file with the *. QGIS extension, the database and the rasters (or the GeoPackage containing our rasters: IGM, Basemap and so on) into our smartphone or tablet.</p> <p>Per impostazione predefinita, QField crea una cartella in cui salvare i progetti (Android/data/ ch.opengis.QField/files), ma \u00e8 sempre meglio memorizzarli su un SSD esterno, dato che se dovessi disinstallare QField dal tuo dispositivo, tutte le cartelle e i file in esse contenuti saranno rimossi con il rischio di cancellare i dati.</p> <p>Dopo aver impostato le basi del progetto GIS in QGIS, \u00e8 necessario esportarlo in QField attraverso un apposito plug-in chiamato QField-Sync.</p> <p>Tuttavia, possiamo eseguire questa operazione anche semplicemente trasferendo (copia e incolla) il progetto QGIS e il relativo dataset sul nostro dispositivo Android.

Vantaggi e svantaggi dell'uso di QField in un lavoro di indagine archeologica e di valutazione del rischio archeologico","text":"<p>QField, come tutti gli strumenti all'avanguardia, ha alcuni limiti legati all'utilizzo dei dispositivi. Il principale di questi potrebbe essere causato dalla scarsa larghezza di banda o dalla mancanza di internet. In questo questo caso, non possiamo avere una buona precisione nella registrazione dei nostri elementi archeologici utilizzando il GNSS. Allo stesso tempo, non saremmo in grado di caricare servizi WMS come Google Satellite, Open Street Map e altri. Un altro svantaggio \u00e8 legato alla durata della batteria: mantenere lo schermo, la connessione dati e il GPS sempre attivi ridurr\u00e0 drasticamente la durata della batteria del nostro dispositivo anche se possiamo portare con noi dei powerbank portatili. D'altra parte, i vantaggi dell'uso di QField sono molti; infatti, ci permette di ridurre molte procedure che avremmo dovuto eseguire se avessimo registrato le caratteristiche archeologiche identificate durante il sondaggio su una mappa cartacea o se avessimo compilato le relative informazioni manualmente su fogli di carta. Inoltre, un altro vantaggio \u00e8 costituito dalla possibilit\u00e0 di utilizzare QField per integrare la fotocamera del dispositivo o un'antenna GNSS.

Lavorare con QField in uno scavo a cielo aperto","text":"<p>In uno scenario di scavo in un'area aperta, i vantaggi e la comodit\u00e0 di utilizzare un'app come QField sono innumerevoli. Questo vale soprattutto per i siti archeologici commerciali dove molto spesso i tempi di realizzazione del lavoro e i budget a disposizione per le indagini archeologiche sono molto stretti. Questo ti costringe a lavorare con la massima ottimizzazione delle tempistiche e delle risorse, nonostante le condizioni meteorologiche e di visibilit\u00e0 sul campo siano spesso scarse (Figura 2).</p> <p> Figura 2 - Un esempio di quando le condizioni meteorologiche e di visibilit\u00e0 sul campo sono scarse. Immagine di Roberto Montagnetti 2019. </p> <p>Vediamo ora perch\u00e9 l'utilizzo di QField facilita la riduzione dei tempi di lavoro e, allo stesso tempo, garantisce un risparmio di risorse da investire nell'indagine archeologica, fornendo un esempio pratico di utilizzo dell'applicazione GIS per Android.</p> <p>In questo tipo di lavoro, il primo passo \u00e8 quello di spogliare l'area da indagare con l'uso di macchinari, con l'obiettivo di rimuovere il terriccio e poi eventualmente il sottosuolo.</p> <p>La fase successiva prevede l'identificazione delle caratteristiche archeologiche sia direttamente sul campo sia confrontando i risultati del telerilevamento aereo e dell'analisi geofisica quando si utilizza questo tipo di tecnologia.</p> <p>Gli elementi archeologici identificati vengono poi rilevati digitalmente tramite GPS o Total Station.</p> <p>Infine, vengono delineati tutti gli interventi di scavo che devono essere completati nell'area di indagine (slot), dove \u00e8 pi\u00f9 rilevante in termini di comprensione della relazione stratigrafica tra gli elementi archeologici individuati.</p> <p>Questa fase del lavoro \u00e8 chiamata \"Pre-Ex\".</p> <p>Il rilievo Pre-Ex costituir\u00e0 la base topografica per la creazione della piattaforma GIS del progetto in QGIS, insieme alla mappa di base dell'area, alle TBM e ad eventuali ortofoto aeree del sito. All'interno della stessa piattaforma, caricheremo anche un geodatabase contenente i layer necessari per la digitalizzazione di quanto segue:</p> <p>a. Gli elementi archeologici identificati sul campo;</p> <p>b. Gli slot previsti;</p> <p>c. I contesti indagati e i relativi livelli;</p> <p>d. Le linee di pianta e di sezione utilizzate per i disegni manuali;</p> <p>e. Tutti gli elementi che potremmo avere bisogno di rilevare durante l'indagine archeologica del sito.</p> <p>Tuttavia, nello stesso database, ci saranno anche delle tabelle relative ai fogli di lavoro.</p> <p>Pertanto, sono paragonabili alla versione digitale dei registri cartacei e di altri documenti correlati che vengono comunemente utilizzati nei cantieri per la documentazione degli scavi.</p> <p>Questo database (quello che segue \u00e8 solo un esempio della struttura di un database. Le tabelle e le geometrie possono essere diverse a seconda delle caratteristiche dei siti e della topologia delle indagini che devono essere svolte. In ogni caso, le tabelle e i layer devono essere in relazione tra loro per poter interagire. QField riconosce le relazioni di progetto impostate in QGIS) \u00e8 composto da:</p> <ol> <li>Siti (Vettore): Contiene l'elenco e la descrizione di tutti i siti in cui la societ\u00e0 sta lavorando.</li> <li>Context_Layer (Vettore): Questo layer rappresenta graficamente tutti i contesti individuati e scavati durante il progetto di scavo.</li> <li>Slots (Vettore): Questo layer rappresenta graficamente tutti gli slot scavati e contiene le informazioni del registro dello slot cartaceo.</li> <li>Livello_Layer (Vettore): Questo layer rappresenta graficamente tutti i livelli rilevati durante lo scavo di ogni slot.</li> <li>Drawings_Vector (Vettore): Questo layer rappresenta graficamente le linee della pianta e della sezione utilizzato per i disegni manuali.</li> <li>Drawing_Point (Vettore): Questo layer rappresenta graficamente i punti attraverso i quali le linee di pianta e di sezione passano.</li> <li>Context_Register (nessuna geometria): registro digitale, che contiene tutte i contesti investigati.</li> <li>Drawings_Register (No geometry): registro digitale di tutti i disegni.</li> <li>Permatrace_Register (nessuna geometria): registro digitale dei fogli di permatrace.</li> <li>Sample_Register (nessuna geometria): registro digitale dei campioni raccolti.</li> <li>Photo_Register (senza geometria): registro digitale di tutte le foto scattate.</li> <li>Small_Find_Register (nessuna geometria): registro digitale di tutti i piccoli reperti raccolti.</li> <li>Finds_Bag_Register (nessuna geometria): registro digitale di tutti i sacchetti di reperti raccolti durante lo scavo.</li> <li>Context_Sheets (senza geometria): Questo layer \u00e8 la versione digitale del registro dei fogli di contesto e contiene tutte le informazioni relative a ciascun contesto indagato.</li> </ol> <p>A questo punto, dobbiamo semplicemente trasferire il progetto master creato in QGIS con tutte le \"relazioni di progetto\" e i \"widget\" sul tablet o sullo smartphone e gestirlo direttamente in loco con QField per apprezzarne immediatamente i vantaggi e la comodit\u00e0 (Figura 3).</p> <p> Figura 3 - Un esempio dello stesso progetto di piattaforma GIS di scavo in area aperta in QGIS (sopra) e in QField (sotto). Immagine di Roberto Montagnetti 2019. </p> <p>Infatti, grazie a questo sistema, gli archeologi che lavorano sul campo saranno in grado di registrare direttamente i numeri di contesto identificati durante lo scavo all'interno di QField, nell'apposita tabella \"registro dei contesti\" del database QField.</p> <p>Questo aspetto accelera gi\u00e0 le operazioni in loco, risparmiando il tempo che generalmente si impiega per andare avanti e indietro dal cantiere alla struttura o dal cantiere all'auto/furgone e viceversa, per la compilazione dei registri cartacei; in particolare, se consideriamo il fatto che, regolarmente, le auto e le piazzole sono situate a una distanza considerevole dall'area di scavo.</p> <p>Inoltre, dato che in genere c'\u00e8 un solo dispositivo sul posto e che questo \u00e8 solitamente tenuto dal capocantiere o dai supervisori, sarebbe pi\u00f9 facile per loro controllare che gli archeologi sul campo assegnino i numeri giusti ai contesti identificati.</p> <p>Molto spesso, in un sito si tende a fare confusione, soprattutto quando l'area di scavo del sito \u00e8 scarsa a causa di condizioni meteorologiche avverse. Oltre ai problemi di cui sopra, possono anche verificarsi degli errori come la registrazione dello stesso elemento con numeri di taglio diversi o l'assegnazione dello stesso numero di contesto a elementi diversi.</p> <p>Questo accade ancora pi\u00f9 frequentemente quando il team sul campo \u00e8 composto da numerosi archeologi che lavorano in sezioni di scavo separate l'una dall'altra. Questi slot possono essere sparsi per l'area di scavo, rendendo pi\u00f9 difficile l'interazione e la comunicazione tra di loro.</p> <p>Questa questione \u00e8 legata anche a un altro problema: per chi lavora sul campo \u00e8 impossibile avere una visione d'insieme costante dell'area di indagine e degli elementi archeologici individuati, il che spesso genera confusione e fa commettere errori durante la registrazione dei numeri di contesto.</p> <p>Da questo punto di vista, quindi, QField rappresenta una vera e propria svolta in quanto offre le seguenti possibilit\u00e0 a chi lavora in cantiere, in qualsiasi momento:</p> <p>i. Avere una panoramica generale dell'area di scavo;</p> <p>ii. Interrogare gli elementi archeologici rilevati;</p> <p>iii. Verificare la forma e l'orientamento degli elementi archeologici identificati nella fase di Pre-Ex, che devono essere scavati anche quando le condizioni del sito sono precarie.</p> <p>QField aiuta a risolvere le varie sfide che si incontrano sul campo: perdite di tempo a causa di tempo inclemente e piovoso e il terreno perennemente zuppo e fangoso smosso da persone e veicoli che accedono continuamente al sito. Questi fattori fanno s\u00ec che gli elementi archeologici identificati diventino irriconoscibili dopo diversi giorni di scavo del sito (Figura 2).</p> <p>Utilizzando il GPS del dispositivo, consente all'utente di navigare all'interno dell'area di scavo e di trovare, anche se con un certo margine di errore, gli elementi archeologici da scavare, anche quando la visibilit\u00e0 sul posto \u00e8 scarsa.</p> <p>Inoltre, in questo modo, quando le condizioni di visibilit\u00e0 sono cattive, \u00e8 pi\u00f9 facile centrare gli slot degli elementi archeologici che sono stati identificati in precedenza nella fase Pre-Ex, evitando cos\u00ec di sbagliare i calcoli per scavare nei siti naturali.</p> <p>Un esempio tipico \u00e8 quando ci sono dei solchi che attraversano il campo e diventa sempre pi\u00f9 difficile vederne l'intera lunghezza a occhio nudo.</p> <p>In genere, per ovviare a questo tipo di problema, gli archeologi utilizzano mappe stampate nell'area di scavo; tuttavia, anche se questo pu\u00f2 essere certamente d'aiuto, nella pratica non sono in alcun modo paragonabili alla comodit\u00e0 delle mappe digitali e di conseguenza a QField per una serie di motivi:</p> <ol> <li>Le mappe stampate si deteriorano molto rapidamente a causa del vento, dell'umidit\u00e0 e soprattutto quando maneggiati da mani umane.</li> <li>Per contenere l'intera area di scavo, spesso devono essere stampati in formati molto grandi, che richiedono plotter particolari, che comportano costi considerevoli e che li rendono difficile da usare.</li> <li>Le mappe cartacee non sono interattive, il che significa che non puoi farci domande.</li> <li>Non risolvono il problema di dover centrare con precisione gli elementi archeologici, che devono essere studiati con gli slot quando le condizioni di visibilit\u00e0 sul sito sono scarse.</li> </ol> <p>In particolare, l'utilizzo di QField in cantiere semplifica il carico di lavoro di manager e supervisori nella pianificazione degli interventi di scavo, consentendo loro di istruire facilmente gli archeologi sul campo direttamente nell'area di scavo. In questo modo, saranno in grado di addestrare il team sul campo con informazioni accurate sugli elementi che dovranno scavare, supportando le loro spiegazioni con l'ausilio grafico del tablet e con i dettagli relativi a ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 stato gi\u00e0 indagato e caricato nel database del progetto.</p> <p>Oltre al lavoro sul campo, QField facilita il lavoro degli archeologi anche nella fase di registrazione, semplificando il loro lavoro nella produzione di documenti. Come abbiamo gi\u00e0 detto, possono interrogare continuamente il tablet per ottenere le informazioni necessarie che devono essere incluse nelle schede di documentazione cartacee, come ad esempio i numeri di sezione o di piano dei contesti che hanno scavato, insieme ai numeri delle foto degli stessi contesti, o qualsiasi altra informazione correlata.</p> <p>Inoltre, sar\u00e0 molto pi\u00f9 facile per loro disegnare le planimetrie di localizzazione che sono generalmente richieste nelle schede di contesto, in quanto avranno a disposizione un numero maggiore di informazioni disponibili per fornire un'interpretazione di ci\u00f2 che hanno scavato.</p> <p>Un altro aspetto molto importante da prendere in considerazione quando si lavora con QField \u00e8 che c'\u00e8 la possibilit\u00e0 di eliminare completamente il processo di registrazione manuale dei numeri di slot, numeri di contesto, numeri di estrazione, numeri di campione, numeri di foto e cos\u00ec via. Allo stesso tempo, utilizzando questo sistema, possiamo anche evitare problemi quali:</p> <ol> <li>L'inserimento manuale dei registri cartacei nel database del progetto;</li> <li>Il problema della decifrazione di calligrafie incomprensibili, che aumentano notevolmente la possibilit\u00e0 di commettere errori di trascrizione.</li> </ol> <p>Infatti, le calligrafie poco chiare sono un problema ricorrente legato alla registrazione manuale della documentazione di scavo e in particolare dei registri. Questo problema influisce anche l'accuratezza delle informazioni che devono essere inserite nel database durante l'informatizzazione.</p> <p>Inoltre, l'archeologo coinvolto nelle pratiche deve includere nella sua documentazione i numeri di contesto, i numeri di disegno e altri tipi di informazioni relative agli elementi archeologici che sono stati scavati e registrati da altri colleghi. In questa circostanza, confondere un numero con un altro, magari a causa della calligrafia poco chiara del collega, \u00e8 un errore molto comune.</p> <p>Lo scenario peggiore significa che:</p> <ol> <li>Non ci sar\u00e0 pi\u00f9 corrispondenza tra i registri digitali del database e quelli cartacei;</li> <li>Le informazioni contenute nelle varie schede contestuali non saranno affidabili;</li> <li>Entrambi i casi (come gi\u00e0 detto).</li> </ol> <p>Pertanto, dovremo dedicare molto tempo e sforzi per rintracciare l'errore e correggerlo.</p> <p>L'uso di una registrazione digitale elimina invece questo problema e facilita il controllo degli errori.</p> <p>Il principale vantaggio degli strumenti GIS \u00e8 che ci permettono di interrogare gli elementi dando la possibilit\u00e0 di effettuare un controllo incrociato dei dati, velocizzando cos\u00ec il processo di verifica.</p> <p>Per fare un esempio pratico, se hai bisogno di modificare il numero di un contesto, di un disegno o di qualsiasi altra cosa all'interno di un registro digitale con un numero, con il \"calcolatore di campo\" di QGIS, diventa un compito facile che richiede solo pochi secondi.</p> <p>Pensa solo a quanto tempo ci vorrebbe per eseguire lo stesso compito utilizzando registri e documentazione solo cartacea, soprattutto quando si lavora con quantit\u00e0 considerevoli di dati raccolti in uno scavo di grandi dimensioni.</p> <p>In questo caso, devi innanzitutto rintracciare la cartella contenente la serie numerica del numero da rivedere, quindi sfogliare uno per uno tutti i registri fino a trovare il numero che deve essere modificato e infine corretto, insieme a tutti i numeri successivi. La correzione non dovr\u00e0 essere effettuata solo nei registri, ma anche all'interno delle sezioni specifiche delle schede contestuali.</p> <p>In altre parole, se un contesto, un disegno o un numero di foto \u00e8 stato registrato in modo errato, non \u00e8 sufficiente correggere solo il registro, ma anche tutti i documenti che si riferiscono al numero che \u00e8 stato citato.</p> <p>Pertanto, utilizzando un registro digitale (tabella), l'operazione richieder\u00e0 solo pochi minuti; Tuttavia, se si lavora a mano sulla documentazione cartacea, potrebbero essere necessarie numerose ore di lavoro.</p> <p>Un ultimo aspetto molto importante da tenere in considerazione \u00e8 il risparmio di carta e, di conseguenza, di denaro. L'uso di QField e della documentazione digitale ci permette di gestire in modo efficiente i dati di scavo. Lavorando in questo modo, non \u00e8 pi\u00f9 necessario stampare i piani di indagine, i registri e le schede di carta.</p> <p>Tuttavia, se l'autorit\u00e0 competente (contea archeologica) o il cliente richiede esplicitamente una versione cartacea di tutta la documentazione prodotta in loco, sar\u00e0 possibile stampare tutto alla fine del progetto, solo dopo aver apportato tutte le modifiche. In questo modo si evita un inutile spreco di carta, oltre a tutti gli altri problemi che sono stati menzionati in precedenza.</p> <p>Anche in questo caso, il \"compositore di stampe\" di QGIS ci permette di sviluppare layout personalizzati che possono essere salvati e utilizzati in qualsiasi momento.</p>"},{"location":"it/success-stories/heritage-impact-assessment/#6-conclusioni","title":"6.

Oggi, infatti, sia i musei che i magazzini delle aziende archeologiche hanno meno spazio a disposizione per l'archiviazione dei faldoni cartacei. A questo punto, sarebbe sarebbe vantaggioso gestire i dati in formato digitale all'inizio del processo di scavo, risparmiando tempo e risorse.</p> <p>La scansione dei documenti PDF dei registri, delle schede contestuali e, in generale, di tutta la documentazione prodotta in loco non \u00e8 una soluzione pratica e sostenibile. Come gi\u00e0 accennato, spesso questa documentazione in progetti di scavo estesi \u00e8 composta da migliaia di fogli cartacei; sfido chiunque a ricostruire una matrice di scavo controllando tutti i rapporti stratigrafici sulla scansione PDF dei documenti.

On push, the original data source will be updated, including the database for database layers.</li> <li>Directly access data source is mainly used for service-based layers that are located on a internet accessible server. The data in these layers are directly modified by QField. Examples are WFS, WM(T)S-layers or layers coming from a database such as PostGIS layers. If the layer is file-based it will be in read-only mode.</li> <li>Remove from project will simply remove the layer from the project (not package it for QField).</li> </ul> <p>With QFieldSync in QGIS it will be possible to update a project already loaded on QFieldCloud.</p> <p>In the event that the changes concern only styles, forms etc. but not the data or the structure of the layers, the QGIS project file (<code>.qgs</code>/<code>.qgz</code>) on the server will simply be updated.</p> <p>If there are changes in the data or the structure of the layers, then the new data source files will be updated.</p> <p>Note that changing the structure (or schema) of the layers such as adding, removing or renaming attributes, changing not null constraints, etc. might have effects. If such changes are pushed to QFieldCloud, please make sure all QField users have pushed their changes in advance.

Such data were digitised into a CAD or GIS software creating the individual site sheets separately on a simple digital document afterwards.</p> <p>Today, QField, thanks to its compatibility with QGIS, allows you to skip the transition from paper to digital or from different software, reducing time and costs.</p> <p>The archaeological survey (for a comprehensive account of methods of the Archaeological survey, see Cambi, Terrenato 1994, pp. 117\u2013143, and Renfrew, Bahn 2016 [1,2]) must be preceded by the construction of a GIS platform that takes into consideration both the data acquired during the field survey phase and the bibliographic ones. For this reason, it will be necessary to work on two tables:</p> <ul> <li>One is spatial, which is useful in the field.</li> <li>The other is alphanumeric.</li> </ul> <p>Both will be joined in a single spatial table, useful for consultation on the GIS desktop. This process is possible through the use of a relational geo-database such as SpatiaLite and PostGIS or, alternatively, through the creation of a join between the tables and the geometries.</p> <p>However, the big advantage of using a geo-database is the ability to create queries capable of merging information from two or more tables into a single table (view) (for more in-depth information on the use of GIS and Geodatabases in archaeology, see Fronza, Nardini, Valenti 2009 [3]).</p> <p>This process further speeds up field work by minimising the data to be stored during archaeological survey.</p> <p>The data collected in the field during the survey will be recorded and digitised through three different layers (point, line and polygon). The attribute tables connected to the three layers record the following information: Project Name (String), Municipality (String), Location (String), Feature Number (Integer), Place Name (String), Location (String), Date (Date), Site Definition (String), Visibility (String) and Photos (String).</p> <p>The attribute values, \u201cProject name\u201d and \u201cFeature Number\u201d, between the two tables must be Unique Constraint in order to identify only one unique \u201cProject name\u201d and only one \u201cFeature Number\u201d.</p> <p>The GIS platform must also have base maps such as Google Satellite, Open Street Map, Orthophotos and so on. In this case, we used the following maps: Carta Tecnica Regionale (1:10.000), Open Street Map e Google Satellite. To make these maps lighter, we created first overviews (pyramids) in QGIS.</p> <p>The positioning of the archaeological features identified can be recorded through the GPS internal device. However, for a greater accuracy, QField can be connected to a GNSS antenna.</p> <p>In archaeological consultancy and archaeological risk assessment jobs, it is recommended to upload into the GIS project an infrastructure layer containing the infrastructure\u2019s geometric information, measurements and others, besides a buffer of itself.</p> <p>After setting the basics of our project on QGIS, we need to export the  project through the use of the QFieldSync plugin within QField. Alternatively, we can carry this out by simply copying the folder containing the project file with the *. QGIS extension, the database and the rasters (or the GeoPackage containing our rasters: IGM, Basemap and so on) into our smartphone or tablet.</p>

Working with QField in an Open Area Excavation","text":"<p>In  an  open  area  excavation  scenario,  the  advantages  and  convenience  of  using  an App  such  as  QField  are  innumerable.  This  is  true  especially  in  commercial  archaeology sites, where very often the deadlines to carry out the work and the budgets available for the archaeological investigation are very tight. This forces you to work with the maximum optimisation of the timing and assets, despite the fact that the weather and visibility conditions in the field are often poor (Figure 2).</p> <p> Figure 2 - An example of when the weather and visibility conditions in the field are poor. Image by Roberto Montagnetti 2019. </p> <p>Now, let us see why the use of QField facilitates the reduction of working times and, at the same time, guarantees the saving of resources to be invested in the archaeological investigation, providing a practical example of using the GIS App for Android.</p> <p>In this kind of work, the first step is to strip the area to be investigated with the use of machinery, aiming to remove the topsoil and then eventually the subsoil.</p> <p>The subsequent step involves the identification of archaeological features both directly in the field and by comparing the results of the aerial remote sensing and geophysical analysis when this type of technology is used.</p> <p>The archaeological features identified are then digitally detected by GPS or Total Station.</p> <p>Finally, all the excavation interventions that need to be completed in the investigation area (slots) are outlined, where it is more relevant in terms of understanding the stratigraphic relationship between the archaeological features identified.</p> <p>This phase of the work is called \u201cPre-Ex\u201d.</p> <p>The Pre-Ex survey will be the topographical base for the creation of the GIS platform of the project in QGIS, together with the base map of the area, the TBM\u2019s and any aerial orthophotos of the site. Within the same platform, we will also upload a geodatabase containing the layers necessary for the digitisation of the following:</p> <p>a. The archaeological features identified in the field;</p> <p>b The slots planned;</p> <p>c. The contexts investigated and their related levels;</p> <p>d. The plan and section lines used for the manual drawings;</p> <p>e. All the elements that we may need to detect during the archaeological investigation of the site.</p> <p>However, in the same database, there will also be tables related to the paperwork sheets.</p> <p>Thus, they are comparable to the digital version of the paper registers and other related paperwork that are commonly used on construction sites for excavation documentation.</p> <p>This database (what comes next is just an example of database structure. Tables and geometries can be different according to the characteristics of the sites and the topology of investigations that must be carried out. In any case, tables and vectors must be related to each other in order to interact. QField recognises the project relations set in QGIS.) is made of:</p> <ol> <li>Sites (Vector): Contains the list and description of all the sites on which the company est\u00e1 a trabalhar.</li> <li>Context_Layer (Vector): This layer graphically represents all the contexts identified and excavated during the excavation project.</li> <li>Slots (Vector): This layer graphically represents all the slots excavated and contains the information of the paper slot register.</li> <li>Level_Layer (Vector): This layer graphically represents all the levels taken during the excavation of each slot.</li> <li>Drawings_Vector (Vector): This layer graphically represents the plan and section lines usado para desenho manual.</li> <li>Drawing_Point (Vector): This layer graphically represents the points through which the plan and section lines pass.</li> <li>Context_Register (No geometry): digital register, which contains all the investigated contextos.</li> <li>Drawings_Register (No geometry): digital register of all the drawings.</li> <li>Permatrace_Register (No geometry): digital register of the permatrace sheets.</li> <li>Sample_Register (No geometry): digital register of the samples collected.</li> <li>Photo_Register (No geometry): digital register of all photos taken.</li> <li>Small_Find_Register (No geometry): digital register of all small finds collected.</li> <li>Finds_Bag_Register (No geometry): digital register of all finds bags collected during a escava\u00e7\u00e3o.</li> <li>Context_Sheets (No geometry): This layer is the digital version of the context sheets register and contains all the information related to each context investigated.</li> </ol> <p>At this point, we need to simply transfer the master project created in QGIS with all the \u201cproject relation\u201d and \u201cwidgets\u201d to the tablet or the smartphone and manage it directly on site with QField to immediately appreciate its advantages and convenience (Figure 3).</p> <p> Figure 3 - An example of the same open area excavation GIS platform project in QGIS (above) and in QField (below). Image by Roberto Montagnetti 2019. </p> <p>In fact, primarily, by using this system, archaeologists who are working in the field will be able to directly register the context numbers identified during the excavation within QField, in the appropriate \u201ccontext register\u201d table in the QField database.</p> <p>This aspect already speeds up on-site operations by saving the time generally taken to go back and forth from the site to the compound or from the site to the car/van and vice versa, for the compilation of paper registers; especially, if we take into consideration the fact that, on a regular basis, cars and compounds are located at a considerable distance away from the excavation area.</p> <p>Additionally, since generally there is only one device on site and this is usually held by the site manager or by the supervisors, this would make it easier for them to check that the field archaeologists are assigning the right numbers to the identified contexts.</p> <p>Very often, on a location tend to become confused, especially when the excavation area of the site is poor due to adverse weather conditions. Along with the above issues, they can also encounter errors such as registering the same feature with different cut numbers or by assigning the same context numbers to different features.</p> <p>This occurs even more frequently when the field team is composed of numerous archaeologists who work in separate excavation slots from each other. These slots can be spread around the excavation area, making interaction and communication between them more challenging.</p> <p>This issue is also linked to another problem, which means, for those who work in the field, it is impossible to have a constant overview of the investigation area and the archaeological features identified, which often causes confusion and making mistakes during the registration of the context numbers.</p> <p>Therefore, from this point of view, QField represents a real breakthrough by giving the following possibilities to the people working on site, at any time:</p> <p>i. To have a general overview of the excavation area;</p> <p>ii. To query the surveyed archaeological features;</p> <p>iii. To check the shape and the orientation of the archaeological features identified in the Pre-Ex phase, which must be dug even when the site conditions are poor.</p> <p>QField aids with various challenges encountered in the field: time wasted due to inclement, wet weather and perpetually sodden and muddy soil churned up by people and vehicles continually accessing the site. These cause the identified archaeological features to become unrecognisable after several days of the site being stripped (Figure 2).</p> <p>By using the device\u2019s GPS, as it allows the user to navigate within the excavation area and to find, albeit with a certain margin of error, the archaeological features that need to be excavated, even when the visibility on site is poor.</p> <p>Similarly, by doing so, when visibility conditions are bad, it is easier to centre with the slots in the archaeological features that have previously been identified in the Pre-Ex phase, which prevents the miscalculation of digging into the natural sites.</p> <p>A typical example of this is when there are furrows running across the field, and it becomes increasingly difficult to see their entire length with the naked eye.</p> <p>Typically, in order to remedy this type of problem, archaeologists use printed maps in the excavation area; however, although this can certainly be a help, in practice, they are in no way comparable to the convenience of digital maps and consequently to QField for a number of reasons:</p> <ol> <li>Printed maps deteriorate very quickly due to wind, humidity and especially when manuseado por m\u00e3os humanas.</li> <li>To contain the entire excavation area, they must often be printed in very large formats, which requires particular plotters, which incurs considerable costs and makes them dif\u00edceis de usar.</li> <li>Paper maps are not interactive, which means that you cannot ask them questions.</li> <li>They do not solve the problem of having to precisely centre the archaeological features, which need to be investigated with the slots when the visibility conditions on the site s\u00e3o pobres.</li> </ol> <p>Notably, the use of QField on site simplifies the workload of managers and supervisors in the planning of the excavation interventions, allowing them to easily instruct field archaeologists directly in the excavation area. By doing so, they will be able to train the field team efficiently with accurate information regarding the features that they will have to dig, supporting their explanation with the graphic aid of the tablet and with details related to what has already been investigated and uploaded into the database of the project.</p> <p>Apart from the fieldwork, QField makes the job easier for archaeologists even in the recording phase, simplifying their work in the production of the paperwork. As we already mentioned, they can continuously query the tablet to obtain the necessary information that needs to be included in their paper documentation sheets, such as the section or plan numbers of the contexts that they have excavated, along with the photo numbers of the same contexts, or any other related information.</p> <p>Furthermore, it will be much easier for them to draw the location plans that are generally required in the context sheets, as they will have much more pieces of information available to provide an interpretation of what they have dug.</p> <p>Another very important aspect to take into consideration when working with QField is that there is a possibility of completely removing the manual registration process of the slot numbers, context numbers, drawing numbers, sample numbers, photo numbers and so on. Simultaneously, by using this system, we can also avoid issues such as:</p> <ol> <li>The manual data-entry of the paper registers into the database of the project;</li> <li>The problem of deciphering incomprehensible calligraphies, which greatly increase the possibility of making transcription mistakes.</li> </ol> <p>In fact, unclear calligraphies are a recurring problem related to the manual recording of the excavation documentation and in particular of the registers. This is also going to affect the accuracy of the information that must be put into the database during computerisation.</p> <p>Additionally, the archaeologist involved in the paperwork must include in his documentation context numbers, drawing numbers and other types of information related to the archaeological features and in relation to his own, which have been excavated and recorded by other colleagues. In this circumstance, to confuse one number for another, perhaps due to the unclear handwriting of the colleague, is a very common mistake.</p> <p>Worst-case scenario means that:</p> <ol> <li>There will no longer be a match between digital registers of the database and paper registers;</li> <li>The information on various context sheets will not be reliable;</li> <li>Both cases (as mentioned above).</li> </ol> <p>Therefore, we will have to spend a lot of time and effort tracking down the error and correcting it.</p> <p>Instead, the use of a digital recording eliminates this problem and facilitates the checking of errors.</p> <p>The main benefit of the GIS tools is that they enable us to query the features by giving us the possibility to cross-check data, which speeds up the checking process.</p> <p>To give a practical example, if you need to adjust the number of a context, or a drawing or anything else within a digital register by a number, with the QGIS \u201cfield calculator\u201d, it becomes an easy task taking only a few seconds.</p> <p>Just think how long it would take to perform the same task using registers and paperonly documentation, especially when working with considerable amounts of data collected within an extensive excavation.</p> <p>In this case, you must first trace the folder containing the numerical series of the number to be revised, then browse one-by-one all the registers until you find the number that needs to be amended and finally corrected, along with all the subsequent numbers. This will not only need to be corrected in the registers, but also within the specific sections of the context sheets.</p> <p>In other words, if a context, drawing or photo number has been registered incorrectly, it is not enough to correct only the register but also all the paperwork that relates to the number that has been mentioned.</p> <p>Therefore, by using a digital register (table), the operation will only take a few minutes; however, if you were working on the paper documentation by hand, it could take numerous hours of hard work.</p> <p>One final significantly important aspect to take into consideration is the saving of paper and consequently the amount of money involved. The use of QField and digital documentation allows us to efficiently manage the excavation data. By working in this way, it is no longer necessary to print out the survey plans, the registers and the paperwork sheets.</p> <p>However, if the competent authority (county archaeology) or the customer explicitly requests a paper version of all the documentation produced on site, it will be possible to print out everything at the end of the project, only once all of the amendments have been made. This helps to avoid unnecessary waste of paper, along with all the other problems that were previously mentioned.</p> <p>Even in this case, the QGIS \u201cprint composer\u201d allows us to develop customised layouts that can be saved and used at any time.</p>"},{"location":"pt/success-stories/heritage-impact-assessment/#6-conclusoes","title":"6. Conclus\u00f5es","text":"<p>In an increasingly digital world, it is unacceptable to continue working on paper especially because, at the end of the process, all paper documentation must be digitised for archiving needs. Today, in fact, both the museums and the warehouses of the archaeological companies have less space available for the storage of paper folders. At this point, it would be beneficial to manage the data in a digital format at the beginning of the excavation process, immediately saving time and resources.</p> <p>Scanning the PDF documents of registers, context sheets and, in general, all documentation produced on site is not a practical and sustainable solution. As previously mentioned, often, this documentation in extensive excavation projects is made up of thousands of paperwork sheets; I challenge anyone to reconstruct an excavation matrix by checking all the stratigraphic reports on the paperwork PDF scan. This kind of job forces you to continually scroll up and down the PDF document in search of the relationships between the various contexts, resulting in a significant waste of time and energy; without any regards to the costs that are involved when scanning in thousands of sheets.</p> <p>Archaeological excavations are constantly driven by strict and increasingly shorter deadlines. The use of GIS for the management of excavation data can no longer be ignored. Currently, the possibility of an \u201cOpen Source\u201d and a \u201cpocket\u201d GIS platform, such as QField, truly represents a unique opportunity to make the work of archaeologists on site easier, faster and more accurate.</p> <p>As previously mentioned, it is much easier to build the matrix and compile the phasing of the archaeological features identified working with a digital system during the Post-Ex phase. Thus, only an instrument such as GIS, which gives us the possibility of launching queries and continuously cross-referencing data, allows us to perform this type of work quickly and efficiently.</p> <p>At the same time, the GIS allows us to have a continuous overview of the data produced on site and to further implement information regarding the investigation by using geospatial analysis, which helps to facilitate the final interpretative reconstruction.</p> <p>In short, the principle of paper lasting forever cannot be accepted any more. Primarily, because it is not true, and secondly, it deteriorates over time, especially when, as in most cases, it is kept in the basements of archives, museums or sites of archaeological companies.</p> <p>In addition, paper documents entail enormous logistical difficulties in terms of sharing and consulting data, in comparison to digital documentation, which can be easily shared.</p> <p>R.M.</p> <p>Institutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.</p> <p>Informed Consent Statement: Not applicable.</p> <p>Refer\u00eancias bibliogr\u00e1ficas</p> <ol> <li>Cambi, F.; Terrenato, N.

You can find the technical details on the different job types in the technical documentation section. In simple words, there exist three different synchronization activities:</p> <ul> <li>From QGIS to QFieldCloud: This synchronization process uploads a complete new \"project package\" and replaces the existing one stored in the cloud. If you are working with GeoPackages it is important to note, that the existing GeoPackage on the cloud will be replaced with the one you have just uploaded.</li> <li>From QFieldCloud to QField: If you want to download the uploaded \"project package\" to your mobile device, QFieldCloud \"packages\" the project into a specific format that is saved in the internal application folder structure. Important to know here is that in case you are working with PostgreSQL databases and have chosen the working mode offline editing then a local GeoPackage of the data will be created in the corresponding folder (make sure to configure your secret properly), unless a direct connection is needed.</li> <li>From QField to QFieldCLoud: Once you are done with collecting data, you can choose among two different synchronization options. The changes made are being applied as so-called deltas. Deltas reflect only the changes made to the different attributes. When pushing to or synchronizing with QFieldCloud, it is only the deltas that are being applied. Unlike in the synchronization process from QGIS to QFieldCloud, the whole GeoPackage is NOT replaced.</li> </ul> <p> Simple Synchronization Overview </p> <p>Consejo</p> <p>There are a few tips, which we recommend to follow in order to avoid synchronization issues or overwritten data.</p> <ol> <li>Do not modify the QGIS project while personnel is working simultaneously in QField. If you synchronize your Desktop version to the cloud, QFieldCloud will overwrite the files. Although there may have been changes applied in QFieldCloud, QFieldSync will not show this by default. If you must work parallel on Desktop, make sure to check the QFieldCloud status and download the most recent data before uploading new files versions from your Desktop.</li> <li>Do not change the data structure before synchronizing the latest field edits. Often, officers work in QGIS and adapt the data structure of the project files, which leads to errors if the changes from QField have not yet been pushed to QFieldCloud.</li> <li>Use uuid's as primary keys, especially when working with relations and in teams. Synchronization often occur due to the lack of adding primary keys to your datasets. Especially, when working with relationships and in teams, if the data were not configured with an according primary key, it may happen that data loss occurs because of simultaneous editing of the data.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"es/get-started/tutorials/advanced-setup-qfc/#modos-de-trabajo","title":"Modos de trabajo","text":"<p>Al configurar un proyecto para QField puedes elegir entre las diferentes opciones de \"Empaquetado\".</p> <ul> <li> <p>Edici\u00f3n sin conexi\u00f3n: Independientemente de si sus archivos est\u00e1n almacenados en un GeoPackage, una base de datos u otro formato, QFieldCloud crear\u00e1 un GeoPackage temporal de todos los datos del proyecto.

Centralized Data Storage - Add all data in the same folder as your .qgs project file</p> <p>Before uploading your project, ensure all relevant data sources (GeoPackages, rasters, etc.) are located in the same directory as your project file (<code>.qgs/.qgz</code>) or in a subdirectory (e.g., <code>./data</code>, <code>./assets</code>). If files are spread across different drives or folders on your computer, QFieldSync and QFieldCloud may fail to package them correctly for the mobile device.</p> <p>2. Managing Unique IDs - Add a unique ID to your layers</p> <p>When multiple users collect data offline simultaneously, standard auto-incrementing IDs (1, 2, 3...) will result in conflict errors when applying the deltas changes data on QFieldCloud.</p> <ul> <li>For Relations: Create a specific text field (e.g., <code>survey_uuid</code>) and use <code>uuid()</code> or <code>uuid('WithoutBraces')</code> as the default value. Use this field for all foreign keys and for primary key if the layer is from PostgreSQL/PostGIS.</li> <li>For the <code>fid</code> (Feature ID): If you are working with GeoPackages, you can reduce conflicts on the internal <code>fid</code> integer column by setting the \"Default Value\" to the expression <code>epoch(now())</code>. This generates a unique integer based on the current timestamp.</li> </ul> <p>Tip</p> <p>To set this up, go to Layer Properties &gt; Attributes Form, select the <code>fid</code> field, and set the Default Value to: </p><pre><code>epoch(now())\n</code></pre> Ensure the \"Apply default value on update\" box is unchecked so the ID remains constant after creation.  <p>3. Relative Paths - Ensure that all attachment paths are relative</p> <p>Absolute paths (e.g., <code>C:\\Users\\{username}\\Downloads\\photo_001.jpg</code>) will break when the project is transferred to a mobile device (Android/iOS), as the file system structure is different.</p> <p>Flujo</p> <ol> <li>Navigate to Project &gt; Properties... &gt; General.</li> <li>Set Save paths to <code>Relative</code>.</li> </ol> <p>4. Stable Layer References in Expressions - Use the Layer Name in expressions, not the Layer ID</p> <p>When writing expressions (for example, inside <code>aggregate()</code> or <code>relation_aggregate()</code>) functions, QGIS allows you to reference layers by their internal ID (e.g., <code>places_2348274...</code>) or their Name (e.g., <code>Places</code>). Always use the Layer Name (e.g., <code>Places</code>).</p> <p>Why? The internal Layer ID changes if you remove and re-add a layer or internally in QFieldCloud when a packaging job is triggered could change, which breaks your expressions. The Layer Name remains stable as long as you do not rename it in the layer tree.</p> <p>5. Formatos de archivo preferidos - Convertir sus capas a GeoPackage</p> <p>QField y QFieldCloud est\u00e1n optimizados para el formato GeoPackage (.gpkg) Aunque QField y QFieldCloud admiten otros formatos, como archivos Shape (<code>.shp</code>), GeoJSON y KML, etc., se recomienda encarecidamente convertir esas capas a GeoPackage antes de comenzar su proyecto.</p> <p>\u00bfC\u00f3mo convertir a GeoPackage?</p> <p>Flujo</p> <ol> <li>En QGIS, haga clic derecho en su capa en el \u00e1rbol de capas.</li> <li>Seleccione Exportar &gt; Guardar objetos como...</li> <li>Establezca Formato a <code>GeoPackage</code></li> <li>En Nombre de archivo, pulse <code>...</code> y navegue a la carpeta de su proyecto. Dele nombre a la nueva base de datos (ej.: notas_puntos.gpkg`)</li> <li>En Nombre de la capa, dele un nombre sencillo a su capa (ej.: <code>notas_puntos</code>)</li> <li>Pulse OK</li> <li>La nueva capa se cargar\u00e1 en el proyecto.

Esto hace que los elementos arqueol\u00f3gicos identificados se vuelvan irreconocibles despu\u00e9s de varios d\u00edas de haber sido despojados del yacimiento (Figura 2).</p> <p>Utilizando el GPS del dispositivo, ya que permite al usuario navegar dentro del \u00e1rea de excavaci\u00f3n y encontrar, aunque con un cierto margen de error, los elementos arqueol\u00f3gicos que hay que excavar, incluso cuando la visibilidad en el lugar es escasa.</p> <p>Asimismo, al hacerlo, cuando las condiciones de visibilidad son malas, es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil centrarse con las aberturas en los objetos arqueol\u00f3gicos que se han identificado previamente en la fase Pre-Ex fase, lo que evita el error de c\u00e1lculo de la excavaci\u00f3n en los lugares naturales.</p> <p>Un ejemplo t\u00edpico de esto es cuando hay surcos que atraviesan el campo, y cada vez es m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil ver toda su longitud a simple vista.</p> <p>Normalmente, para remediar este tipo de problemas, los arque\u00f3logos utilizan mapas impresos de la zona de excavaci\u00f3n; sin embargo, aunque esto puede ser ciertamente una ayuda, en la pr\u00e1ctica, no son de ninguna manera tan convenientes como los mapas digitales y, por tanto, de QField, por una serie de razones:</p> <ol> <li>Los mapas impresos se deterioran muy r\u00e1pidamente debido al viento, la humedad y especialmente cuando son manipulados por manos humanas.</li> <li>Para contener toda la zona de excavaci\u00f3n, a menudo deben imprimirse en formatos muy grandes, que requiere trazadores particulares, lo que supone un coste considerable y los hace dificultoso de usar.</li> <li>Los mapas en papel no son interactivos, lo que significa que no puede hacerles preguntas.</li> <li>No resuelven el problema de tener que centrar con precisi\u00f3n los elementos arqueol\u00f3gicos, que deben ser investigados con las ranuras cuando las condiciones de visibilidad en el sitio son paup\u00e9rrimos.</li> </ol> <p>En particular, el uso de QField en la obra simplifica la carga de trabajo de los directores y supervisores en la planificaci\u00f3n de las intervenciones de excavaci\u00f3n, permiti\u00e9ndoles instruir f\u00e1cilmente a los arque\u00f3logos de campo directamente en la zona de excavaci\u00f3n. De este modo, podr\u00e1n formar al equipo de campo con informaci\u00f3n precisa sobre los elementos que tendr\u00e1n que excavar, apoyando su explicaci\u00f3n con la ayuda gr\u00e1fica de la tableta y con detalles relacionados con lo que ya se ha investigado y cargado en la base de datos del proyecto.</p> <p>Adem\u00e1s del trabajo de campo, QField facilita el trabajo de los arque\u00f3logos incluso en la fase de registro, simplificando su trabajo en la elaboraci\u00f3n de la documentaci\u00f3n. Como ya hemos mencionado, pueden consultar continuamente la tableta para obtener la informaci\u00f3n necesaria para incluirla en sus hojas de documentaci\u00f3n en papel, como los n\u00fameros de secci\u00f3n o de plano de los contextos que han excavado, junto con los n\u00fameros de las fotos de los mismos contextos, o cualquier otra informaci\u00f3n relacionada.</p> <p>Adem\u00e1s, les resultar\u00e1 mucho m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil dibujar los planos de situaci\u00f3n que se que generalmente se exigen en las hojas de contexto, ya que dispondr\u00e1n de mucha m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n para interpretar lo que han excavado.</p> <p>Otro aspecto muy importante a tener en cuenta cuando se trabaja con QField es que existe la posibilidad de eliminar por completo el proceso de registro manual de los n\u00fameros de abertura, n\u00fameros de contexto, n\u00fameros de dibujo, n\u00fameros de muestra, n\u00fameros de foto y etc. Simult\u00e1neamente, al utilizar este sistema, tambi\u00e9n podemos evitar cuestiones como:</p> <ol> <li>La introducci\u00f3n manual de los registros en papel en la base de datos del proyecto;</li> <li>El problema de descifrar caligraf\u00edas incomprensibles, que aumentan enormemente la posibilidad de cometer errores de transcripci\u00f3n.</li> </ol> <p>De hecho, las caligraf\u00edas poco claras son un problema recurrente relacionado con el registro manual de la documentaci\u00f3n de las excavaciones y, en particular, de los registros. Esto tambi\u00e9n va a afectar la exactitud de la informaci\u00f3n que debe introducirse en la base de datos durante la informatizaci\u00f3n.</p> <p>Adem\u00e1s, el arque\u00f3logo que intervenga en los tr\u00e1mites debe incluir en su documentaci\u00f3n n\u00fameros de contexto, n\u00fameros de dibujo y otros tipos de informaci\u00f3n relacionados con los elementos arqueol\u00f3gicos y en relaci\u00f3n con los suyos, que han sido excavados y registrados por otros colegas. En esta circunstancia, confundir un n\u00famero por otro tal vez debido a la letra poco clara del colega, es un error muy com\u00fan.</p> <p>El peor de los casos significa que:</p> <ol> <li>Ya no habr\u00e1 coincidencia entre los registros digitales de la base de datos y el papel registros;</li> <li>La informaci\u00f3n que figura en varias hojas de contexto no ser\u00e1 fiable;</li> <li>En ambos casos (como se ha mencionado anteriormente).</li> </ol> <p>Por lo tanto, tendremos que dedicar mucho tiempo y esfuerzo a rastrear el error y corregirlo.</p> <p>En cambio, el uso de una grabaci\u00f3n digital elimina este problema y facilita la comprobaci\u00f3n de los errores.</p> <p>La principal ventaja de las herramientas del SIG es que nos permiten consultar los objetos d\u00e1ndonos la posibilidad de cruzar los datos, lo que acelera el proceso de comprobaci\u00f3n.</p> <p>Por poner un ejemplo pr\u00e1ctico, si necesita ajustar el n\u00famero de un contexto, o un dibujo o cualquier otra cosa dentro de un registro digital por un n\u00famero, con la \"calculadora de campo\" de QGIS, se convierte en una tarea f\u00e1cil que s\u00f3lo lleva unos segundos.</p> <p>Piense en el tiempo que le llevar\u00eda realizar la misma tarea utilizando registros y documentaci\u00f3n en papel, especialmente cuando se trabaja con cantidades considerables de datos recogidos en una excavaci\u00f3n de gran envergadura.</p> <p>En este caso, primero debe rastrear la carpeta que contiene la serie num\u00e9rica del n\u00famero que hay que revisar, y luego recorrer uno a uno todos los registros hasta encontrar el n\u00famero que hay que modificar y finalmente corregir, junto con todos los n\u00fameros posteriores. No s\u00f3lo habr\u00e1 que corregirlo en los registros, sino tambi\u00e9n en las secciones espec\u00edficas de las hojas de contexto.</p> <p>En otras palabras, si un contexto, un dibujo o un n\u00famero de foto se ha registrado incorrectamente no basta con corregir s\u00f3lo el registro, sino tambi\u00e9n toda la documentaci\u00f3n relacionada con el n\u00famero que se ha mencionado.</p> <p>Por lo tanto, al utilizar un registro digital (tabla), la operaci\u00f3n s\u00f3lo le llevar\u00e1 unos minutos; sin embargo, si se trabajara en la documentaci\u00f3n en papel a mano, podr\u00eda llevar numerosas horas de trabajo.</p> <p>Un \u00faltimo aspecto significativamente importante a tener en cuenta es el ahorro de papel y, en consecuencia, la cantidad de dinero que supone. El uso de QField y la documentaci\u00f3n nos permite gestionar eficazmente los datos de las excavaciones. Al trabajar de este modo, ya no es necesario imprimir los planos de prospecci\u00f3n, los registros y las hojas de papeleo.</p> <p>No obstante, si la autoridad competente (arqueolog\u00eda comarcal) o el cliente solicitan expl\u00edcitamente una versi\u00f3n en papel de toda la documentaci\u00f3n elaborada in situ, ser\u00e1 posible imprimir todo al final del proyecto, s\u00f3lo una vez que se hayan realizado todas las modificaciones. Esto ayuda a evitar el desperdicio innecesario de papel, junto con todos los dem\u00e1s problemas que se han mencionado anteriormente.</p> <p>Incluso en este caso, el \"compositor de impresi\u00f3n\" de QGIS nos permite desarrollar dise\u00f1os personalizados que se pueden guardar y utilizar en cualquier momento.</p>"},{"location":"es/success-stories/heritage-impact-assessment/#6-conclusiones","title":"6. Conclusiones","text":"<p>En un mundo cada vez m\u00e1s digital, es inaceptable seguir trabajando en papel especialmente porque, al final del proceso, toda la documentaci\u00f3n en papel debe ser digitalizada para necesidades de archivo. Hoy, de hecho, tanto los museos como los almacenes de las empresas arqueol\u00f3gicas tienen menos espacio disponible para el almacenamiento de carpetas de papel. En este punto, ser\u00eda beneficioso gestionar los datos en formato digital al principio del proceso de excavaci\u00f3n, ahorrando inmediatamente tiempo y recursos. de la excavaci\u00f3n, ahorrando inmediatamente tiempo y recursos.</p> <p>Escanear los documentos PDF de los registros, las hojas de contexto y, en general, toda la documentaci\u00f3n producida in situ no es una soluci\u00f3n pr\u00e1ctica y sostenible. Como ya se ha mencionado anteriormente, a menudo, esta documentaci\u00f3n en proyectos de excavaci\u00f3n extensos se compone de miles de hojas de papel; reto a cualquiera a reconstruir una matriz de excavaci\u00f3n revisando todos los informes estratigr\u00e1ficos en el escaneo del PDF del papeleo. Este tipo de trabajo obliga a desplazarse continuamente hacia arriba y hacia abajo por el documento PDF en busca de las relaciones entre los distintos contextos, lo que supone una importante p\u00e9rdida de tiempo y energ\u00eda; sin ninguna consideraci\u00f3n a los costes que supone el escaneo de miles de hojas.</p> <p>Las excavaciones arqueol\u00f3gicas se ven constantemente impulsadas por plazos estrictos y cada vez m\u00e1s cortos plazos. El uso de los SIG para la gesti\u00f3n de los datos de las excavaciones ya no puede ser ignorado. Actualmente, la posibilidad de contar con una plataforma SIG \"de bolsillo\" y de c\u00f3digo abierto, como QField representa realmente una oportunidad \u00fanica para facilitar el trabajo de los arque\u00f3logos sobre el terreno, m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido y preciso.</p> <p>Como se ha mencionado anteriormente, es mucho m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil construir la matriz y compilar el escalonamiento de los elementos arqueol\u00f3gicos identificados trabajando con un sistema digital durante la fase Post-Ex. As\u00ed, s\u00f3lo un instrumento como el SIG, que nos da la posibilidad de lanzar consultas y cruzar datos continuamente, nos permite realizar este tipo de trabajo r\u00e1pida y eficazmente.</p> <p>Al mismo tiempo, el SIG nos permite tener una visi\u00f3n continua de los datos producidos in situ y aplicar la informaci\u00f3n relativa a la investigaci\u00f3n mediante el an\u00e1lisis geoespacial, lo que ayuda a facilitar la reconstrucci\u00f3n interpretativa final.</p> <p>En resumen, ya no se puede aceptar el principio de que el papel es eterno. En primer lugar porque no es cierto, y en segundo lugar, se deteriora con el tiempo, especialmente cuando, como en la mayor\u00eda de los casos, se guarda en los s\u00f3tanos de los archivos, museos o yacimientos de empresas arqueol\u00f3gicas.</p> <p>Adem\u00e1s, los documentos en papel conllevan enormes dificultades log\u00edsticas para compartir y consultar datos, en comparaci\u00f3n con la documentaci\u00f3n digital, que puede compartirse f\u00e1cilmente.</p> <p>R.M.</p> <p>Declaraci\u00f3n de la Junta de Revisi\u00f3n Institucional: No aplicable.</p> <p>Declaraci\u00f3n de consentimiento informado: No aplicable.</p> <p>Referencias</p> <ol> <li>Cambi, F.; Terrenato, N.

These conversions are achieved via \"Layer Actions\". Under the project configuration dialog you can set the required \"Action\" for each layer.

Gpkg, Shp, Tiff)): The layer will be copied to the packaged project folder but not be tracked. A new copy in the packaged project folder will be made. Note: In case that you have multiple layers within one GeoPackage, all layers will be uploaded despite only one of them being present in the QGIS project. It is recommended to have one layer per Gpkg unless strictly necessary. Refer to common best practices for additional tips</p> </li> <li> <p>Keep existing (copy if missing): The layer source will be left untouched. In the case of a long-term project, where synchronization is frequently happening, it is advisable to use this option to not re-package the file every time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Offline editing: The layer is copied into the packaged project folder. This layer is traced and the changes made are recorded in a changelog, which QFS will use later for the synchronization. When synchronizing the changes back, this log will be replaced and all changes also be applied to the original source layer. This allows you to keep track of the changes and also to work with multiple users. Note: There is no conflict handling in place.</p> </li> <li> <p>Directly access data source: (non-file-based only) The data will directly be accessed. This option is only available for online data such as WMS/WFS or Postgres layers.

Such data were digitised into a CAD or GIS software creating the individual site sheets separately on a simple digital document afterwards.</p> <p>Today, QField, thanks to its compatibility with QGIS, allows you to skip the transition from paper to digital or from different software, reducing time and costs.</p> <p>The archaeological survey (for a comprehensive account of methods of the Archaeological survey, see Cambi, Terrenato 1994, pp. 117\u2013143, and Renfrew, Bahn 2016 [1,2]) must be preceded by the construction of a GIS platform that takes into consideration both the data acquired during the field survey phase and the bibliographic ones. For this reason, it will be necessary to work on two tables:</p> <ul> <li>One is spatial, which is useful in the field.</li> <li>The other is alphanumeric.</li> </ul> <p>Both will be joined in a single spatial table, useful for consultation on the GIS desktop. This process is possible through the use of a relational geo-database such as SpatiaLite and PostGIS or, alternatively, through the creation of a join between the tables and the geometries.</p> <p>However, the big advantage of using a geo-database is the ability to create queries capable of merging information from two or more tables into a single table (view) (for more in-depth information on the use of GIS and Geodatabases in archaeology, see Fronza, Nardini, Valenti 2009 [3]).</p> <p>This process further speeds up field work by minimising the data to be stored during archaeological survey.</p> <p>The data collected in the field during the survey will be recorded and digitised through three different layers (point, line and polygon). The attribute tables connected to the three layers record the following information: Project Name (String), Municipality (String), Location (String), Feature Number (Integer), Place Name (String), Location (String), Date (Date), Site Definition (String), Visibility (String) and Photos (String).</p> <p>The attribute values, \u201cProject name\u201d and \u201cFeature Number\u201d, between the two tables must be Unique Constraint in order to identify only one unique \u201cProject name\u201d and only one \u201cFeature Number\u201d.</p> <p>The GIS platform must also have base maps such as Google Satellite, Open Street Map, Orthophotos and so on. In this case, we used the following maps: Carta Tecnica Regionale (1:10.000), Open Street Map e Google Satellite. To make these maps lighter, we created first overviews (pyramids) in QGIS.</p> <p>The positioning of the archaeological features identified can be recorded through the GPS internal device. However, for a greater accuracy, QField can be connected to a GNSS antenna.</p> <p>In archaeological consultancy and archaeological risk assessment jobs, it is recommended to upload into the GIS project an infrastructure layer containing the infrastructure\u2019s geometric information, measurements and others, besides a buffer of itself.</p> <p>After setting the basics of our project on QGIS, we need to export the  project through the use of the QFieldSync plugin within QField. Alternatively, we can carry this out by simply copying the folder containing the project file with the *.

This  is  true  especially  in  commercial  archaeology sites, where very often the deadlines to carry out the work and the budgets available for the archaeological investigation are very tight. This forces you to work with the maximum optimisation of the timing and assets, despite the fact that the weather and visibility conditions in the field are often poor (Figure 2).</p> <p> Figure 2 - An example of when the weather and visibility conditions in the field are poor. Image by Roberto Montagnetti 2019. </p> <p>Now, let us see why the use of QField facilitates the reduction of working times and, at the same time, guarantees the saving of resources to be invested in the archaeological investigation, providing a practical example of using the GIS App for Android.</p> <p>In this kind of work, the first step is to strip the area to be investigated with the use of machinery, aiming to remove the topsoil and then eventually the subsoil.</p> <p>The subsequent step involves the identification of archaeological features both directly in the field and by comparing the results of the aerial remote sensing and geophysical analysis when this type of technology is used.</p> <p>The archaeological features identified are then digitally detected by GPS or Total Station.</p> <p>Finally, all the excavation interventions that need to be completed in the investigation area (slots) are outlined, where it is more relevant in terms of understanding the stratigraphic relationship between the archaeological features identified.</p> <p>This phase of the work is called \u201cPre-Ex\u201d.</p> <p>The Pre-Ex survey will be the topographical base for the creation of the GIS platform of the project in QGIS, together with the base map of the area, the TBM\u2019s and any aerial orthophotos of the site. Within the same platform, we will also upload a geodatabase containing the layers necessary for the digitisation of the following:</p> <p>a. The archaeological features identified in the field;</p> <p>b The slots planned;</p> <p>c. The contexts investigated and their related levels;</p> <p>d. The plan and section lines used for the manual drawings;</p> <p>e. All the elements that we may need to detect during the archaeological investigation of the site.</p> <p>However, in the same database, there will also be tables related to the paperwork sheets.</p> <p>Thus, they are comparable to the digital version of the paper registers and other related paperwork that are commonly used on construction sites for excavation documentation.</p> <p>This database (what comes next is just an example of database structure. Tables and geometries can be different according to the characteristics of the sites and the topology of investigations that must be carried out. In any case, tables and vectors must be related to each other in order to interact. QField recognises the project relations set in QGIS.) is made of:</p> <ol> <li>Sites (Vector): Contains the list and description of all the sites on which the company toiminnassa.</li> <li>Context_Layer (Vector): This layer graphically represents all the contexts identified and excavated during the excavation project.</li> <li>Slots (Vector): This layer graphically represents all the slots excavated and contains the information of the paper slot register.</li> <li>Level_Layer (Vector): This layer graphically represents all the levels taken during the excavation of each slot.</li> <li>Drawings_Vector (Vector): This layer graphically represents the plan and section lines used for the manual drawings.</li> <li>Drawing_Point (Vector): This layer graphically represents the points through which the plan and section lines pass.</li> <li>Context_Register (No geometry): digital register, which contains all the investigated kontekstit.</li> <li>Drawings_Register (No geometry): digital register of all the drawings.</li> <li>Permatrace_Register (No geometry): digital register of the permatrace sheets.</li> <li>Sample_Register (No geometry): digital register of the samples collected.</li> <li>Photo_Register (No geometry): digital register of all photos taken.</li> <li>Small_Find_Register (No geometry): digital register of all small finds collected.</li> <li>Finds_Bag_Register (No geometry): digital register of all finds bags collected during kaivaus.</li> <li>Context_Sheets (No geometry): This layer is the digital version of the context sheets register and contains all the information related to each context investigated.</li> </ol> <p>At this point, we need to simply transfer the master project created in QGIS with all the \u201cproject relation\u201d and \u201cwidgets\u201d to the tablet or the smartphone and manage it directly on site with QField to immediately appreciate its advantages and convenience (Figure 3).</p> <p> Figure 3 - An example of the same open area excavation GIS platform project in QGIS (above) and in QField (below). Image by Roberto Montagnetti 2019. </p> <p>In fact, primarily, by using this system, archaeologists who are working in the field will be able to directly register the context numbers identified during the excavation within QField, in the appropriate \u201ccontext register\u201d table in the QField database.</p> <p>This aspect already speeds up on-site operations by saving the time generally taken to go back and forth from the site to the compound or from the site to the car/van and vice versa, for the compilation of paper registers; especially, if we take into consideration the fact that, on a regular basis, cars and compounds are located at a considerable distance away from the excavation area.</p> <p>Additionally, since generally there is only one device on site and this is usually held by the site manager or by the supervisors, this would make it easier for them to check that the field archaeologists are assigning the right numbers to the identified contexts.</p> <p>Very often, on a location tend to become confused, especially when the excavation area of the site is poor due to adverse weather conditions. Along with the above issues, they can also encounter errors such as registering the same feature with different cut numbers or by assigning the same context numbers to different features.</p> <p>This occurs even more frequently when the field team is composed of numerous archaeologists who work in separate excavation slots from each other. These slots can be spread around the excavation area, making interaction and communication between them more challenging.</p> <p>This issue is also linked to another problem, which means, for those who work in the field, it is impossible to have a constant overview of the investigation area and the archaeological features identified, which often causes confusion and making mistakes during the registration of the context numbers.</p> <p>Therefore, from this point of view, QField represents a real breakthrough by giving the following possibilities to the people working on site, at any time:</p> <p>i. To have a general overview of the excavation area;</p> <p>ii. To query the surveyed archaeological features;</p> <p>iii. To check the shape and the orientation of the archaeological features identified in the Pre-Ex phase, which must be dug even when the site conditions are poor.</p> <p>QField aids with various challenges encountered in the field: time wasted due to inclement, wet weather and perpetually sodden and muddy soil churned up by people and vehicles continually accessing the site. These cause the identified archaeological features to become unrecognisable after several days of the site being stripped (Figure 2).</p> <p>By using the device\u2019s GPS, as it allows the user to navigate within the excavation area and to find, albeit with a certain margin of error, the archaeological features that need to be excavated, even when the visibility on site is poor.</p> <p>Similarly, by doing so, when visibility conditions are bad, it is easier to centre with the slots in the archaeological features that have previously been identified in the Pre-Ex phase, which prevents the miscalculation of digging into the natural sites.</p> <p>A typical example of this is when there are furrows running across the field, and it becomes increasingly difficult to see their entire length with the naked eye.</p> <p>Typically, in order to remedy this type of problem, archaeologists use printed maps in the excavation area; however, although this can certainly be a help, in practice, they are in no way comparable to the convenience of digital maps and consequently to QField for a number of reasons:</p> <ol> <li>Printed maps deteriorate very quickly due to wind, humidity and especially when handled by human hands.</li> <li>To contain the entire excavation area, they must often be printed in very large formats, which requires particular plotters, which incurs considerable costs and makes them vaikea k\u00e4ytt\u00e4\u00e4.</li> <li>Paper maps are not interactive, which means that you cannot ask them questions.</li> <li>They do not solve the problem of having to precisely centre the archaeological features, which need to be investigated with the slots when the visibility conditions on the site ovat k\u00f6yhi\u00e4.</li> </ol> <p>Notably, the use of QField on site simplifies the workload of managers and supervisors in the planning of the excavation interventions, allowing them to easily instruct field archaeologists directly in the excavation area. By doing so, they will be able to train the field team efficiently with accurate information regarding the features that they will have to dig, supporting their explanation with the graphic aid of the tablet and with details related to what has already been investigated and uploaded into the database of the project.</p> <p>Apart from the fieldwork, QField makes the job easier for archaeologists even in the recording phase, simplifying their work in the production of the paperwork. As we already mentioned, they can continuously query the tablet to obtain the necessary information that needs to be included in their paper documentation sheets, such as the section or plan numbers of the contexts that they have excavated, along with the photo numbers of the same contexts, or any other related information.</p> <p>Furthermore, it will be much easier for them to draw the location plans that are generally required in the context sheets, as they will have much more pieces of information available to provide an interpretation of what they have dug.</p> <p>Another very important aspect to take into consideration when working with QField is that there is a possibility of completely removing the manual registration process of the slot numbers, context numbers, drawing numbers, sample numbers, photo numbers and so on. Simultaneously, by using this system, we can also avoid issues such as:</p> <ol> <li>The manual data-entry of the paper registers into the database of the project;</li> <li>The problem of deciphering incomprehensible calligraphies, which greatly increase the possibility of making transcription mistakes.</li> </ol> <p>In fact, unclear calligraphies are a recurring problem related to the manual recording of the excavation documentation and in particular of the registers. This is also going to affect the accuracy of the information that must be put into the database during computerisation.</p> <p>Additionally, the archaeologist involved in the paperwork must include in his documentation context numbers, drawing numbers and other types of information related to the archaeological features and in relation to his own, which have been excavated and recorded by other colleagues. In this circumstance, to confuse one number for another, perhaps due to the unclear handwriting of the colleague, is a very common mistake.</p> <p>Worst-case scenario means that:</p> <ol> <li>There will no longer be a match between digital registers of the database and paper rekisterit;</li> <li>The information on various context sheets will not be reliable;</li> <li>Both cases (as mentioned above).</li> </ol> <p>Therefore, we will have to spend a lot of time and effort tracking down the error and correcting it.</p> <p>Instead, the use of a digital recording eliminates this problem and facilitates the checking of errors.</p> <p>The main benefit of the GIS tools is that they enable us to query the features by giving us the possibility to cross-check data, which speeds up the checking process.</p> <p>To give a practical example, if you need to adjust the number of a context, or a drawing or anything else within a digital register by a number, with the QGIS \u201cfield calculator\u201d, it becomes an easy task taking only a few seconds.</p> <p>Just think how long it would take to perform the same task using registers and paperonly documentation, especially when working with considerable amounts of data collected within an extensive excavation.</p> <p>In this case, you must first trace the folder containing the numerical series of the number to be revised, then browse one-by-one all the registers until you find the number that needs to be amended and finally corrected, along with all the subsequent numbers. This will not only need to be corrected in the registers, but also within the specific sections of the context sheets.</p> <p>In other words, if a context, drawing or photo number has been registered incorrectly, it is not enough to correct only the register but also all the paperwork that relates to the number that has been mentioned.</p> <p>Therefore, by using a digital register (table), the operation will only take a few minutes; however, if you were working on the paper documentation by hand, it could take numerous hours of hard work.</p> <p>One final significantly important aspect to take into consideration is the saving of paper and consequently the amount of money involved. The use of QField and digital documentation allows us to efficiently manage the excavation data. By working in this way, it is no longer necessary to print out the survey plans, the registers and the paperwork sheets.</p> <p>However, if the competent authority (county archaeology) or the customer explicitly requests a paper version of all the documentation produced on site, it will be possible to print out everything at the end of the project, only once all of the amendments have been made. This helps to avoid unnecessary waste of paper, along with all the other problems that were previously mentioned.</p> <p>Even in this case, the QGIS \u201cprint composer\u201d allows us to develop customised layouts that can be saved and used at any time.</p>"},{"location":"fi/success-stories/heritage-impact-assessment/#6-loppupaatelmat","title":"6. Loppup\u00e4\u00e4telm\u00e4t","text":"<p>In an increasingly digital world, it is unacceptable to continue working on paper especially because, at the end of the process, all paper documentation must be digitised for archiving needs. Today, in fact, both the museums and the warehouses of the archaeological companies have less space available for the storage of paper folders. At this point, it would be beneficial to manage the data in a digital format at the beginning of the excavation process, immediately saving time and resources.</p> <p>Scanning the PDF documents of registers, context sheets and, in general, all documentation produced on site is not a practical and sustainable solution. As previously mentioned, often, this documentation in extensive excavation projects is made up of thousands of paperwork sheets; I challenge anyone to reconstruct an excavation matrix by checking all the stratigraphic reports on the paperwork PDF scan. This kind of job forces you to continually scroll up and down the PDF document in search of the relationships between the various contexts, resulting in a significant waste of time and energy; without any regards to the costs that are involved when scanning in thousands of sheets.</p> <p>Archaeological excavations are constantly driven by strict and increasingly shorter deadlines. The use of GIS for the management of excavation data can no longer be ignored. Currently, the possibility of an \u201cOpen Source\u201d and a \u201cpocket\u201d GIS platform, such as QField, truly represents a unique opportunity to make the work of archaeologists on site easier, faster and more accurate.</p> <p>As previously mentioned, it is much easier to build the matrix and compile the phasing of the archaeological features identified working with a digital system during the Post-Ex phase. Thus, only an instrument such as GIS, which gives us the possibility of launching queries and continuously cross-referencing data, allows us to perform this type of work quickly and efficiently.</p> <p>At the same time, the GIS allows us to have a continuous overview of the data produced on site and to further implement information regarding the investigation by using geospatial analysis, which helps to facilitate the final interpretative reconstruction.</p> <p>In short, the principle of paper lasting forever cannot be accepted any more. Primarily, because it is not true, and secondly, it deteriorates over time, especially when, as in most cases, it is kept in the basements of archives, museums or sites of archaeological companies.</p> <p>In addition, paper documents entail enormous logistical difficulties in terms of sharing and consulting data, in comparison to digital documentation, which can be easily shared.</p> <p>R.M.</p> <p>Institutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.</p> <p>Informed Consent Statement: Not applicable.</p> <p>Referenssit</p> <ol> <li>Cambi, F.; Terrenato, N.

Centralized Data Storage - Add all data in the same folder as your .qgs project file</p> <p>Before uploading your project, ensure all relevant data sources (GeoPackages, rasters, etc.) are located in the same directory as your project file (<code>.qgs/.qgz</code>) or in a subdirectory (e.g., <code>./data</code>, <code>./assets</code>). If files are spread across different drives or folders on your computer, QFieldSync and QFieldCloud may fail to package them correctly for the mobile device.</p> <p>2. Managing Unique IDs - Add a unique ID to your layers</p> <p>When multiple users collect data offline simultaneously, standard auto-incrementing IDs (1, 2, 3...) will result in conflict errors when applying the deltas changes data on QFieldCloud.</p> <ul> <li>For Relations: Create a specific text field (e.g., <code>survey_uuid</code>) and use <code>uuid()</code> or <code>uuid('WithoutBraces')</code> as the default value. Use this field for all foreign keys and for primary key if the layer is from PostgreSQL/PostGIS.</li> <li>For the <code>fid</code> (Feature ID): If you are working with GeoPackages, you can reduce conflicts on the internal <code>fid</code> integer column by setting the \"Default Value\" to the expression <code>epoch(now())</code>. This generates a unique integer based on the current timestamp.</li> </ul> <p>Tip</p> <p>To set this up, go to Layer Properties &gt; Attributes Form, select the <code>fid</code> field, and set the Default Value to: </p><pre><code>epoch(now())\n</code></pre> Ensure the \"Apply default value on update\" box is unchecked so the ID remains constant after creation.  <p>3. Relative Paths - Ensure that all attachment paths are relative</p> <p>Absolute paths (e.g., <code>C:\\Users\\{username}\\Downloads\\photo_001.jpg</code>) will break when the project is transferred to a mobile device (Android/iOS), as the file system structure is different.</p> <p>Flux</p> <ol> <li>Navigate to Project &gt; Properties... &gt; General.</li> <li>Set Save paths to <code>Relative</code>.</li> </ol> <p>4. Stable Layer References in Expressions - Use the Layer Name in expressions, not the Layer ID</p> <p>When writing expressions (for example, inside <code>aggregate()</code> or <code>relation_aggregate()</code>) functions, QGIS allows you to reference layers by their internal ID (e.g., <code>places_2348274...</code>) or their Name (e.g., <code>Places</code>). Always use the Layer Name (e.g., <code>Places</code>).</p> <p>Why? The internal Layer ID changes if you remove and re-add a layer or internally in QFieldCloud when a packaging job is triggered could change, which breaks your expressions. The Layer Name remains stable as long as you do not rename it in the layer tree.</p> <p>5. Preferred File Formats - Convert your layers to GeoPackage</p> <p>QField and QFieldCloud are optimized for the GeoPackage (.gpkg) format. While QField and QFieldCloud support others formats like Shapefiles (<code>.shp</code>), GeoJSON, and KML, etc., is strongly recommend converting these layers to GeoPackage before starting your project.</p> <p>How to Convert to GeoPackage?</p> <p>Flux</p> <ol> <li>In QGIS, right-click your layer in the layer tree.</li> <li>Select Export &gt; Save Features As...</li> <li>Set Format to <code>GeoPackage</code></li> <li>In File name, click <code>...</code> and navigate to your project folder. Give the new database a name (e.g., notes_points.gpkg`)</li> <li>In Layer name, give your layer a simple name (e.g., <code>notes_points</code>)</li> <li>Click OK</li> <li>The new layer will load into your project. You can now remove the old layer</li> </ol> <p>6. Modular File Structure - Store one layer per GeoPackage</p> <p>QFieldCloud manages versions and backups at the file level. Every time changes are synchronized, a backup of the modified file is created.</p> <ul> <li>The Risk: If you store multiple layers in a single GeoPackage (e.g., <code>survey_data.gpkg</code> containing Trees, Roads, and Buildings), restoring a backup to fix an error in the Trees layer will also roll back valid work done on Roads and Buildings during that same period.</li> <li>The Solution: Save each layer in its own separate GeoPackage (e.g., <code>trees.gpkg</code>, <code>roads.gpkg</code>).     This allows you to restore a previous version of one specific layer without losing data in others.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"ro/get-started/tutorials/advanced-setup-qfc/#automatic-push-to-qfieldcloud","title":"Automatic push to QFieldCloud","text":"<p>With this functionality, you can enforce automatic pushing of pending changes to QField devices in the field, as well as specify the interval in between automated pushes.

Concluzii","text":"<p>In an increasingly digital world, it is unacceptable to continue working on paper especially because, at the end of the process, all paper documentation must be digitised for archiving needs. Today, in fact, both the museums and the warehouses of the archaeological companies have less space available for the storage of paper folders. At this point, it would be beneficial to manage the data in a digital format at the beginning of the excavation process, immediately saving time and resources.</p> <p>Scanning the PDF documents of registers, context sheets and, in general, all documentation produced on site is not a practical and sustainable solution. As previously mentioned, often, this documentation in extensive excavation projects is made up of thousands of paperwork sheets; I challenge anyone to reconstruct an excavation matrix by checking all the stratigraphic reports on the paperwork PDF scan. This kind of job forces you to continually scroll up and down the PDF document in search of the relationships between the various contexts, resulting in a significant waste of time and energy; without any regards to the costs that are involved when scanning in thousands of sheets.</p> <p>Archaeological excavations are constantly driven by strict and increasingly shorter deadlines. The use of GIS for the management of excavation data can no longer be ignored. Currently, the possibility of an \u201cOpen Source\u201d and a \u201cpocket\u201d GIS platform, such as QField, truly represents a unique opportunity to make the work of archaeologists on site easier, faster and more accurate.</p> <p>As previously mentioned, it is much easier to build the matrix and compile the phasing of the archaeological features identified working with a digital system during the Post-Ex phase. Thus, only an instrument such as GIS, which gives us the possibility of launching queries and continuously cross-referencing data, allows us to perform this type of work quickly and efficiently.</p> <p>At the same time, the GIS allows us to have a continuous overview of the data produced on site and to further implement information regarding the investigation by using geospatial analysis, which helps to facilitate the final interpretative reconstruction.</p> <p>In short, the principle of paper lasting forever cannot be accepted any more. Primarily, because it is not true, and secondly, it deteriorates over time, especially when, as in most cases, it is kept in the basements of archives, museums or sites of archaeological companies.</p> <p>In addition, paper documents entail enormous logistical difficulties in terms of sharing and consulting data, in comparison to digital documentation, which can be easily shared.</p> <p>R.M.</p> <p>Institutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.</p> <p>Informed Consent Statement: Not applicable.</p> <p>References</p> <ol> <li>Cambi, F.; Terrenato, N.
