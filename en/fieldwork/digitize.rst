Collect features
================

To start digitizing new features, enable the **Edit mode** in the main menu (*pencil button*) and select the layer on which you want to add a new feature (the layer will be highlighted in grey).

Points
------

Navigate the crosshair in the center of the screen to the desired location and
click the **+ button** at the lower right of the screen to confirm the creation of a
new point feature. 

You can use the **keep centered** button to force the crosshair to center on your location if you have enabled the GPS.

Lines and polygons
------------------

Navigate the crosshair in the center of the screen to the desired start of the line or polygon and click the **Plus (+) button** at the lower right of the screen to add the first node.

Proceed with adding points to form you line or polygon by clicking the **Plus (+) button** each time you want to add a new node.

Click the **Minus (-) button** to remove the last added node.

Click the **Close (X) button** to cancel the feature creation completely.

When you have added a least 2 nodes for a line or 3 nodes for a polygon, a **Save button** will appear. Click on it to finish your sketch.

Attribute form
--------------

After digitizing a geometry, the attribute form will be displayed if it is not suppressed
and the user will be asked to enter the attributes for the new feature.
The form which appears allows entering attribute values for the new feature. The checkboxes
at the right of every attribute allow for remembering each attribute individually.
The next time you will add a feature on the same layer, these attributes will be already pre-filled.

Delete features
===============

Deleting features is only possible in digitize mode.

To delete a feature, identify it first by a short tap on it. Then select it with a long press
in the identification list, select further features to delete if you want and click the
trash button to confirm the deletion.

Edit features
=============

To edit, tap on **Menu button -> pencil.**

You can edit an existing feature by moving, adding or deleting the vertex and also spliting. 

Vertex tool

It is possible to move and delete vertices of geometries and add new ones.
