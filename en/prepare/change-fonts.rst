Using a specific font
=====================

In QField you are able to use all the font you want.

There is two differents possibility to do it:

1. By adding the fonts (.ttf or .otf) in the device in the folder `<device root>/QField/fonts`.
2. By adding the fonts (.ttf or .otf) in the same folder as the QGIS project (.qgs or .qgz)
