Using additional fonts
======================

In QField, you are able to use all the fonts you want.

There are two different possibilities to register additional fonts:


1. By adding fonts (.ttf or .otf) on the device in the folder `<device root>/QField/fonts`; those will be made accessible to all projects and individual datasets.

2. By adding fonts (.ttf or .otf) in the same folder as a given project file (.qgs or .qgz); those will be accessible only when viewing that project file.
