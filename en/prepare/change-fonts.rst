Using additional fonts

=====================

In QField, you are able to use all the fonts you want.

There are two different possibilities to register additional fontst:


1. By adding fonts (.ttf or .otf) on the device in the folder `<device root>/QField/fonts`; those will be made accessible to all projects and individual datasets.

2. By adding the fonts (.ttf or .otf) in the same folder as the QGIS project (.qgs or .qgz).
