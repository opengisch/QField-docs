# Case Studies

The QField project is always looking for people to publish QField case
studies (user stories) on the QField website. Therefore we kindly ask
institutions, universities, authorities, and companies to write down
their experience in using QField to solve their problems in a certain
project or their every day live. Please
[contact](https://opengis.ch/#contact) us, if you want to send us your
story, we'd be delighted to publish it.
