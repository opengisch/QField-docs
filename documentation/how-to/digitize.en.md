# Digitize

QField allows to digitize, edit and delete point, line and polygon features while in the field.

## Collect features
:material-tablet-android:{ .device-icon } Fieldwork

To start digitizing new features, enable the *Edit mode* by clicking on the *pencil icon* 
in the side dashboard and selecting the layer within which you want to add new features.

!![](../assets/images/activate-edit-mode.png)

The current layer within which features are to be added is highlighted in green.

### Adding point features

Navigate the crosshair in the center of the screen to the desired
location and click the *Plus (+) button* at the lower right of the screen to
confirm the creation of a new point feature.

You can use the *lock to position* button to force the crosshair to
center on your location if you have enabled positioning.

### Adding line or polygon features

Navigate the crosshair in the center of the screen to the desired start
of the line or polygon and click the *Plus (+) button* at the lower
right of the screen to add the first node.

Proceed with adding points to form you line or polygon by clicking the
*Plus (+) button* each time you want to add a new node.

Click the *Minus (-) button* to remove the last added node.

When you have added a least 2 nodes for a line or 3 nodes for a polygon,
a *Save button* will appear. Click on it to finish your geometry.

While digitizing, you can click the *(x) button* to cancel the current feature creation.

!!! note
    QField insures that digitized geometries will not have duplicate vertices and respects
the geometry precision settings from the currently selected layer.

### Attribute form

After digitizing a geometry, the attribute form will appear allowing you
to edit attribute values for the newly-added feature. 

!!! note
    you can supress the attribute form upon feature addition via a configuration option
for a given layer via its properties dialog in QGIS

#### Remember attribute values

For quick collection of rather homogeneus datasets, it is crucial to not
having to enter the same attribute values over an over. The checkboxes
at the right of every attribute allow remembering of the last entered value for
each attribute individually so that the next time you will add a feature on the same
layer, these attributes will be automatically pre-filled.

## Geometry editing
:material-tablet-android:{ .device-icon } Fieldwork

To edit the geometry of pre-existing features, enable the *Edit mode* by tapping on 
the *pencil icon* in QField's side dashboard.

Once in edit mode, a new *Edit geometry* button will appear in the title bar of an identified
feature form. Clicking on the button will activate the geometry editor environment which offers
four tools:

- A vertex editor tool;
- A geometry split tool;
- A geometry reshape tool; and
- A geometry ring tool.

### Vertex tool

The vertex editor allows you to move or delete pre-existing vertices as well as adding new
vertices to geometries.

### Split tool

The split tool allows you to split line and polygon geometries into two halves, one of which will
become a new feature of its own.

### Reshape tool

The reshape tool allows you to change line and polygon geometries by drawing shapes which will
result a reshaped line following the edge of the drawn shape or a polygon with the drawn shapped
used to clip or expand the geometry.

### Ring tool

The ring tool allows you to digitize rings (i.e. holes) into polygon geometries. Once a ring
is created, QField will offer the possibility of filling the ring with a new feature.

### Demonstration of geometries editing

## Merging features

QField allows you to merge features and their geometries into a single feature. To do so, identify two (or more)
features on the map, select them in the features list and merge them by selecting
the *Merge Selected Features* in the *Menu (⁝) Button*.

## Freehand digitizing

The freehand digitizing mode allows you to "draw" lines and polygons
using their stylus pen or mouse. The mode is available for line and polygon
feature additions as well as the above-mentioned geometry editor's rings,
split, and reshape tools.

The freehand digitizing mode is activated through a new toolbar button
which appears when QField is set to editing mode and a stylus pen or
a mouse is hovering the map canvas while a line or polygon vector is selected.

## Topological editing

If topological editing is activated on the project QGIS before exporting
for QField, shared nodes of neighbouring geometries are modified
together when moving / deleting vertices and additional vertices are
added to segments when a new node is added from neightbouring
geometries.

### Multi-editing of attributes

QField allows you to select multiple features and edit their attributes all at once.
In some cases, it can result in very efficient worflows. To do so, identify two (or more)
features on the map, select them in the features list and merge them by selecting
the *Edit feature* button in the list's title bar.

## Delete features
:material-tablet-android:{ .device-icon } Fieldwork

Deleting features is only possible in digitize mode.

!![](../assets/images/delete_features.webp,250px)

To delete a feature, identify it first by a short tap on it. Then select
it with a long press in the identification list, select further features
to delete if you want and click the trash button to confirm the
deletion.

## Snapping
:material-desktop-mac:{ .device-icon } Desktop preparation

While digitizing new features, new points can be snapped to existing
geometries.

All configuration can be done in *Project > Snapping Settings*

### Snapping Types

It is possible to snap new points

-   only to nodes of existing geomtries
-   only to segments of existing geomtries
-   to nodes and segments of existing geomtries

### Snapping to layers

It is also possible to only snap to one or a few layers.

### Snapping tolerance

The snapping tolerance can be specified in map units or pixels.

In almost any case, the units should be set to pixels. We made good
experiences with a tolerance value of 20.
