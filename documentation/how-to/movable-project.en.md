# Portable project

To manually synchronize your QGIS project, you will need a portable
version of your QGIS project file (`.qgs`, `.qgz`). Portable means that all paths are relative and datasets are reachable from the device.


## Configure a portable project
:material-monitor: Desktop preparation

Check that
*Project* > *Properties* > *General* > *Save paths*
is set to *Relative* and that all required data
files are in the same folder like the QGIS project file or in a subfolder.

You can learn more how to prepare your projects for fieldwork in
[Get Started with QFieldCloud (recommended)](../get-started/tutorials/get-started-qfc.md)
or [Get Started with QFieldSync](../get-started/tutorials/get-started-qfs.md) tutorials.
