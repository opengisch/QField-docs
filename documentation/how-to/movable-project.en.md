# Movable project

To manually synchronise your QGIS project, you will need a portable
version of your .qgs file. Portable means that all paths are relative
and datasets are reachable from the device.

Check that
`Project --> Project Properties --> General --> Save paths`
is set to "Relative" and that all required data
files are in the same folder like the .qgs file or in a subfolder.

For increased productivity, we suggest having a look at
`qfieldcloud` and `qfieldsync`
