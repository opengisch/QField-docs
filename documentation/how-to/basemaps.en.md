# Base maps

QField is able to load a base map from a web service or use an existing project as Base Map. 
QField is also able to directly use vector data and raster data without a QGIS
project.

## Configure a web service as base map
:material-desktop-mac:{ .device-icon } Desktop preparation

In QGIS with the plugin QFieldSync, set the base map to the "Project
Configuration"

!![basemap configuration](../assets/images/qfield-sync_basemap.png)

Then make the package of the project to load it on your device.

!![package](../assets/images/qfield-sync_package1.png)

Below the result on QField.
