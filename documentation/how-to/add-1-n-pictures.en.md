# Add a series of pictures to a feature

You can add one or more pictures to a feature. Below you find an example
how to proceed.

## Creating two tables

We will need two tables. One table where the features are stored and one
with a list of pictures.

### Apiary

-   `id` (UUID)
-   `geometry`
-   \...

### Apiary_pictures

-   `id`
-   `apiary_id` (UUID)
-   `path` (TEXT)
-   \...

## Relations

Create a relation with:

-   `apiary` Referenced layer
-   `id` Referenced field
-   `apiary_picture` Referencing layer
-   `apiary_id` Referencing field
-   `strength` Composition

## Widgets

### apiary

Set the default value of the field id to `uuid()`. No need to show it in
the form.

Set the relation widget to `Many to one relation` and add the relation
to the form

## Geotagging

Some mobile devices will require Open Camera to be installed in order to
enable geotagging.

To enable geotagging perform the following steps:

1.  In QField, go to the settings and make sure "Use native Camera" is
    activated
2.  Install the [Open Camera app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sourceforge.opencamera&hl=en&gl=US)
    on your mobile device
3.  Within the Open Camera settings, make sure geotagging is enabled
4.  Within you mobile device settings, set the default camera app to
    Open Camera
5.  Completed! Open Camera will now be utilized while taking pictures
    with QField
