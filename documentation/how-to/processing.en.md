# Processing Algorithms

QField offers access to a number of processing algorithms to modify digitized features and their geometries.

## Showing available algorithms

Running algorithms against your features is done through the features list drawer. First, identify one or more features by tapping on the map canvas and toggle multi-selection mode by long pressing on one of the identified features. Once you've checked all features to be processed, click on the 3-dot menu and select the _Process Selected Feature(s)_ item.

By default, only the algorithms which are flagged as favorites will be shown. Clicking on the _All algorithms_ tab will show the full list where you can add or remove favorites.

## Running an algorithm

When an algorithm has been selected, a list of parameters will be displayed, regrouped into general and advanced ones within two distinct tabs. A third tab is available to access the algorithm's help content. For most algorithms, a live preview of the manipulated geometry will be overlayed on top of the map canvas offering an immediate feedback while parameters.

Once parameters are set to your liking, click on the check button within the drawer's title bar to run the algorithm.
