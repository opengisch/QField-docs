# How-to guides

QField leverages the power of QGIS to comfortably configure your
projects. After setting up everything, you can then synchronise your
project and any additional files to your device and immediately get
down to work.

Synchronising your projects to your teams' devices, can be done in
various way. The QFieldSync plugin helps preparing and packaging QGIS
projects for QField and distributing it to your devices. For a
seamless integration experience and for managing teams we highly
suggest using QFieldCloud.

QField is build to be very user friendly and intuitive. We suggest
starting it and opening a demo project to get used to the powerful
interaction possibilities.

Here you'll find plenty of resources on how to configure and interact
