Once the installation process is finished, it is possible to start
hiding the nodes of the legend of our project.

2.  When you finish the layer/group selection, click *Make selected layers and groups invisible*. You will notice the selected layers
    and groups have disappear from the layers panel. They are still
    available in the project for visualization and joins, though.
3.  Save your project, you can use the section QFieldSync plugin to save
    your project, or save your geopackage and project in the same
    folder.
