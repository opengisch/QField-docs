# QField Plugins

QField has a QML/Javascript plugin framework through which additional functionalities and
features can be scripted.

## Types of plugins

Plugins can be served in two ways:

- as a project-specific plugin that will be active for the duration of a given project session;
- as an application plugin that will be activated when QField launches.

!!! note
    A permission dialog is shown prior to activating a plugin, providing you with the possibility
    of granting or denying individual plugins.

### Project plugins

Project plugins are deployed as a sidecar file to a given project file and must share the same
file name with a .qml extension. For example, if your project file is “tree_inventory_qfield.qgs”,
the plugin’s main QML file must be “tree_inventory_qfield.qml”.

For cloud projects, you simply add the relevant QML file into your local cloud project folder
and upload the newly added file on QGIS using qfieldsync. This method insures a smooth plugin
deployment and update to devices on the field.

For non-cloud projects, refer to the QField [storage handling documentation page](../get-started/storage.md)
to learn how to import projects onto devices.

### Application plugins

Application plugins are installed through a plugins popup accessed from QField’s Settings
panel. Simply hit the ‘Install plugin from URL’ button and paste in a URL pointing to a
zipped plugin file.

Once installed, the plugin will appear in the plugins list found in the popup, with a switch
to toggle the activation of the plugin.
