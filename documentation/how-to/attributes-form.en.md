# Attribute form

QField creates forms that are similar to QGIS, but with some differences.
QGIS field widgets are supported on a best-effort basis and optimized for mobile use.


| Widget type        | Support          | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Attribute form configuration

In order to customize the attribute form, it is necessary to use the drag and drop designer in QGIS or to a use pre-written UI file.
Like for QGIS you can make use of powerful expressions to populate the different fields.
Additionally, to the ones available there are [QFieldCloud specific variables](../reference/expression_variables.md#qfieldcloud), which can be utilized inside the attribute form.

### Editable

The *editable* flag of fields is respected.

### Remember last values

QField offers more fine-grained control over the last used values than QGIS, and uses its own settings instead of the QGIS ones.

### Suppress attribute form

The setting *suppress attribute form* is directly applied to the
QField form.

### Drag and drop designer forms

Groups and Tabs from Drag and Drop designer forms are supported.

In the "Attributes Form," you can structure your forms using various containers, such as tabs and groups, and enhance interactivity by incorporating expression-based conditional visibility.
By enabling the [Drag and Drop Designer](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/vector_properties.html#vector-attributes-menu), you gain the flexibility to re-order attribute fields, as well as gaining access to widgets that are not directly tied to specific fields (e.g., HTML/QML widgets).

!![](../assets/images/drag-and-drop-designer-attribute-forms.png)

!![](../assets/images/qfield-show-group-by-conditional.png)

## Configure a Relation Widget
:material-monitor: Desktop preparation

For detailed information on setting up layer relations in QGIS, please refer to the [setting relations between multiple layers](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/joins_relations.html#setting-relations-between-multiple-layers) QGIS documentation.
To further control the visibility and number of related items shown in QField, see the instructions for configuring [Maximum items visibility for QField](../get-started/tutorials/get-started-qfs.md#configuring-maximum-items-visibility-for-qfield).

!![](../assets/images/relation_editor_widget_list.png)

The relation widget shows all the referencing child features in a list.
If enabled, it is possible to add, delete and open them.

The visual identification of the list entries is done via the *Display Expression* of the child layer.

### Key handling


Since the parent primary key is used as foreign key in the referencing child features, the primary key must be safe to use (it must be unique) also after syncronizing back to the desktop.
Therefore it is recommended to use UUIDs for primary keys.
See [Working with Geopackages](../get-started/tutorials/advanced-setup-qfc/#working-with-geopackages) for further information. <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->

It is possible to already add children from a parent that is about to be added.
This option will be blocked if there is no valid primary key on the parent or the constraints are violated.
In case the adding of the parent feature is canceled after some children have been added already, the children are deleted as well.

### Many-To-Many relations

On many-to-many relationships, according to the cardinality setting in the *QGIS Vector Layer Properties*, on adding, deleting or opening an
entry in the list effects directly the child layer (on direct cardinality) or the linking table (on many-to-one cardinality).

The second case is usually used when there are additional relation information (e.g. percentage) in the linking table.

!![](../assets/images/relation_widget_cardinality.png)

In case of the many-to-one cardinality on many-to-many relations the *Display Expression* needs to be set on the linking table.

### Configuring Ordered Relations for QGIS and QField

The **Ordered Relation Editor** widget allows the reordering of linked child features based on a specific field.

#### 1. Install the Plugin

Make sure you have installed the [Ordered Relation Editor](https://github.com/opengisch/qgis-ordered-relation-editor) plugin from the official repository or through the "Plugin Manager" in QGIS.

#### 2. Configure the Layout

Navigate to the **Attributes Form** section of your layer settings and set the layout editor to **Drag and Drop Designer**.

#### 3. Set Up the Relation Editor Widget

In the **Relation** widget type dropdown, select **Ordered Relation Editor**. Then, configure the widget using the following settings:

- **Ordering Field**: Specify the field in the child layer that will be used to determine the order of the features.

- **Description**: Define an expression to be displayed for each child feature in the list.

- **Image Path (Optional)**: Provide a path to an image or icon to visually enhance the list. This is an expression that resolves dynamically.

!![Widget configuration in QGIS](../assets/images/ordered_relation_widget_configuration.png)

!![QField](../assets/images/ordered_relation_widget.webp,400px)

### Configuring an item threshold for Value Map Editor Widgets

To enhance the user experience within QField, it is possible to control the item threshold at which point the value map editor widgets switch to a toggle buttons interface.
This feature allows users to quickly access items in QField when there are few and providing a more intuitive interface when dealing with a large number of items.

#### To activate the Toggle Button Interface:

1. Open **Layer Properties** by right-clicking on the desired layer and selecting 'Properties' from the menu.

2. Navigate to the **QField** tab located within the Layer Properties dialog.

3. Here, you will find an option to specify the quantity of items that will trigger the transition to a toggle button interface.
Enter the preferred threshold value according to your needs.

!![QField Value Map Editor as Buttons](../assets/images/qfield-value-map-editor-buttons.png,300px)

## Configuring the Attachment Widget
:material-monitor: Desktop preparation

The widget type *Attachment* is used with fields that store the path to files.

It can be used to:

- show and take photos or add pictures from the gallery
- listen and record sound clips
- show and record videos
- show links to external files like PDFs or documents

!![Form attachment picture](../assets/images/attachement-setting-picture.png)

!![Form attachment audio](../assets/images/attachement-setting-audio.png)

!![Form attachment video](../assets/images/attachement-setting-video.png)

The path should be set to relative.
The pictures, audios, videos, pdf's and documents are stored then in a sub-directory of the project, where the link stored in the textfield is pointing to.

!!! note
    QGIS 3.30 or newer is required for the audio and video functionality

In QField the attachments are displayed.
By clicking the icons symbol the camera or audio record is started to update the pictures, videos or audios with a new media.

!![Media](../assets/images/attachments-qfield-media.png,300px)

On synchronization the sub-directory with the pictures, videos audios, pdf's and documents has to be copied as well.

The option *hyperlink* on the attachment widget will disable the camera functionality and enable a hyperlink to open a document (pdf, doc, \...).

![](../assets/images/hyperlink_option.png)

## Configurable attachment path
:material-monitor: Desktop preparation

QFieldSync provides the possibility to configure the path of attachments.

- Go to _QFieldSync plugin > Layers Properties_

Use expressions to specify the path of the attachments. By default, pictures are saved into the "DCIM" folder, audio recordings are saved into the "audio" folder and videos are saved into "video" with a timestamp as name.

!![Paths](../assets/images/paths-saving-media.png)

## Configure a Value Relation Widget
:material-monitor: Desktop preparation

The widget *Value Relation* offers values from a related table in a
combobox. You can select *layer*, *key column* and *value column*. Several
options are available to change the standard behaviors: *allow null value*, *order by value* and *allow multiple selections*. The widget will
display a drop-down or multiple-select list of the referenced features.

!![](../assets/images/value_relation_widget.webp,300px)


### Group Values in the Value Relation Widget

You can organize and optimize the appearance of your *Value Relation widgets* by grouping related items together.
This feature allows you to categorize the values in a dropdown list or in a table view based on the content of a chosen column.

For example, if you have a list of cities, you can group them by their respective states.
This makes it easier for users to navigate and find the values they need, especially in lists with a large number of items.

#### Configuration

Grouping is configured within the Value Relation widget's settings using the following options:

- **Group column**: Choose the column from the layer that will be used to organize the items.
The values from this column will act as group title.
- **Display group name**: Check this box to display the group title as distinct header within the widget.
This creates a clear separation between the different groups, making the list easier to navigate.

!![First configuration](../assets/images/grouping_value_relations_widget_qgis_setting_001.png)

!![Second configuration](../assets/images/grouping_value_relations_widget_qgis_setting_002.png)

!![Third configuration](../assets/images/grouping_value_relations_widget_qgis_setting_003.png)

!![Different configurations on QField](../assets/images/grouping_value_relations_widget_qfield_show_gruped.png)

## Configure Conditional Visibility
:material-monitor: Desktop preparation

Groups can be hidden based on an expression.
This is useful when certain attributes are only required under certain conditions.
As an example imagine mapping trees.
Some of them might have a disease and you have a list of possible deseases.
To not clutter the form with many fields, make a group and configure a visibility expression for a group "diseases".
Add a field "disease" with the data type *boolean*.
Only when the checkbox is checked, the list of diseases will be available to you.

!![Configuration of a group box that will only be shown if the checkbox "desease" is checked.](../assets/images/conditional_visibility_configuration.png)

In QField it will look like in the video below.

!![](../assets/images/conditional_visibility.webp,300px)


## Define Constraints
:material-monitor: Desktop preparation

Attribute fields can have constraints attached.
Constraints are rules in the form of expressions.
Before a feature can be saved all constraints need to be met.
A description can be added that is shown if a constraint is not satisfied.

!![Configuration of a constraint within a range](../assets/images/constraint_configuration.png)

### Common use cases

You cannot enter an elevation value higher than the highest mountain in
this country.

``` sql
"elevation" < 5000
```

It is required to fill in an identifier.

``` sql
"identifier" IS NOT NULL
```

## Define Default Values
:material-monitor: Desktop preparation

Fields can have default values configured.
Default values are inserted into the attribute form when digitizing a new feature.
They are visible and can be modified as long as the field is editable.

!![Configuration of a formatted date as default value](../assets/images/default_value_configuration.png)

## Working with expressions

When creating expressions for projects intended to be used with QField, it is recommended to use layer names rather than layer IDs.
This recommendation stems from the fact that during the project conversion process via QFieldSync, the resulting layers may receive different IDs, which can lead to incorrect expression evaluations.
By using layer names, you ensure that expressions are evaluated consistently and accurately across different project states.

!![Using layer names in expressions](../assets/images/using_layer_name_in_expressions.png)

### Additional variables

For more information regarding storing information related to your position in object attributes, refer to the deticated [GNSS documentation](./gnss.md).

For QFieldCloud users, two variables can be used in expressions including attribute form's default values:
- `@cloud_username` which returns the  name of the currently logged in QFieldCloud user.
- `@cloud_useremail` which returns the email address of the currently logged in QFieldCloud user.

### Common use cases

Insert positioning information as variable:

``` sql
@position_horizontal_accuracy
```

Insert the current date and time:

``` sql
now()
```

Insert the length of the digitized line:

``` sql
length($geometry)
```

Configure global variables on the device and insert them.

``` sql
@operator_name
```

If you want to assign a region code based on the location where a new feature is inserted, you can do so by using an aggregate expression:

``` sql
aggregate( layer:='regions', aggregate:='max', expression:="code", filter:=intersects( $geometry, geometry( @parent ) ) )
```

To transform the coordinates received from \@position_coordinate to the coordinate system of your project:

``` sql
x(transform(@position_coordinate, 'EPSG:4326', @project_crs ))
y(transform(@position_coordinate, 'EPSG:4326', @project_crs ))
```

::: {#snapping_results}
If you want to use the snapping results after drawing a line, you can use the [\@snapping_results]{.title-ref} variable.
The following code extracts the value of the attribute [id]{.title-ref} of the snapping match of the first point of a line.
:::

``` sql
with_variable(
  'first_snapped_point',
  array_first( @snapping_results ),
  attribute(
    get_feature_by_id(
      @first_snapped_point['layer'],
      @first_snapped_point['feature_id']
    ),
    'id'
  )
)
```

## Search in value relation and relation reference widget

It is possible to search values in a *value relation* or *relation reference* widget using the magnifying glass next to the field.

!![](../assets/images/autocomplete_search_value.webp,300px)

!!! note
    Define the *display expression* for the concerned layers, this will be used for searching for features.
    This is configured under *Vector Layer Properties > Display*

## Configure Auto-complete Value
:material-monitor: Desktop preparation

The "Use completer" checkbox must be checked to be able to use the auto-complete in the value relation.

!![Enable auto-complete within QGIS](../assets/images/autocomplet_form.png)

Here is a video showing how it works on QField

!![](../assets/images/autocomplete_typing.webp,300px)

## Define QML Widgets

Custom QML widgets can be useful to integrate advanced actions into forms.
In this example we define add a button that open a third-party map and navigation app.
This is useful to open e.g. turn-by-turn navigations on the device-native app for the user.

```qml
import QtQuick 2.0
import QtQuick.Controls 2.0

Button {
    width: 200
    height: width/5
    text: "Open in Maps"
    onClicked: {
        Qt.openUrlExternally(expression.evaluate("'geo:0,0?q=' || $y || ',' || $x"));
    }
}
```

The `geo` URI above is adapted to work with Android. For Apple Maps the URI can be changed to `'geo:' || $y || ',' || $x`.
