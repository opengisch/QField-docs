# Supported Data Formats

QField supports a wide variety of formats via QGIS data providers and
GDAL. This page offers a non-exhaustive list of supported data formats.

If you don't find your favorite data format on this table, please check
if it works and [adapt the list above](https://github.com/opengisch/QField-docs/edit/master/en/project-management/dataformat.rst)
to share your findings. If it does not work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/opengisch/OSGeo4A/issues). We will be happy to
help you with the implementation.

### Raster data

Raster data can become quite big quickly, when working with uncompressed
tiff files it's often several Gb of data. Especially on mobile devices,
this is inefficient.

## Use GeoPackage

We recommend to us the geopackage format to deal with raster data. The
following commands will convert a file called `raster.tif` to a file
`raster.gpkg` with pyramids. Make sure you adjust `EPSG:21781` to your
desired CRS.

``` bash
gdal_translate --config OGR_SQLITE_SYNCHRONOUS OFF -co  APPEND_SUBDATASET=YES -co TILE_FORMAT=WEBP -a_srs EPSG:21781 -of GPKG raster.tif raster.gpkg
gdaladdo --config OGR_SQLITE_SYNCHRONOUS OFF -r AVERAGE raster.gpkg 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256
```
