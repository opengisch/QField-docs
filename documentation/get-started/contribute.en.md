## Contribute

QField is an open source project.
It is free to share, use and modify and it will stay like that.
We are very happy if this app helps you in whatever creative way you may use it.
If you found it useful, we will be even happier if you could give something back.

### QField Community platform

Signup and join the [QField Community's Platform](https://community.qfield.org/) <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->.

 The community's platform is the platform, where you create the content yourself, where you can engage with the core developers and collaborate across the globe.
 We want to encourage anyone to participate and join the community.
 Only together we can create a better world.
