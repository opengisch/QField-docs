## Certification Process

For each of your courses, we kindly request that you furnish training materials, encompassing exercises, lectures, and data.
These materials will undergo a review process to ascertain their currency, accuracy, and quality.
Should there be any concerns regarding the quality of the material, we may respectfully request revisions.

OPENGIS.ch will handle the review.

If accepted as a QField Certified Organization, your contributions will be published for transparency.

If approved, you must pay a â‚¬20 certification fee to the QField project for each certificate you issue. This establishes a mechanism for financial support for the project. Certificate payments are made using online credit card transactions or, on request, by regular invoice and SEPA wire transfer. Payments can be handled in batches for many certificates at once.
