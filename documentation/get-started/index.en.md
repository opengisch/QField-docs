# Get started with QField and QFieldCloud

## QField

### What is it?

QField is an open-source application that allows painless fieldwork and synchronisation with your local QGIS projects.
You can both use it in online and offline settings, link to external databases or work with simple geospatial formats.
Once your QGIS project is ready for fieldwork you needs to be "packaged" with the [QFieldSync Plugin](../get-started/tutorials/get-started-qfs.md).
There are several ways in which you can get access to the project in QField on your mobile device.
