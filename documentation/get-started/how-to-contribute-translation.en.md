# Contributing to the Translation

Translations for the QField app are managed through the **Transifex** platform.

## 1. Access the Translation Platform

1. Go to the [OPENGIS Dashboard on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/opengisch/).
2. Log in or create an account on Transifex.

## 2. Choose a Language to Contribute

1. Select a project you want to contribute to.
2. Select the language you want to contribute to.
3. Look for languages that need translation. These will have a "Translate" button next to them. Click on it.

## 4. Translate Strings

1. For each untranslated string:

    - Enter the equivalent translation in the "Type your translation here" field.
    - Ensure the translation is accurate and contextually appropriate.

2. Follow these important guidelines while translating:

    - **Preserve Cases**: Retain uppercase and lowercase letters as required.
    - **Preserve Reserved Words and Formatting**: Do not alter placeholders like `()`, `%1`, `<strong>`, or `<br>`.

## 5. Review Your Translation

- Confirm that the translation aligns with the guidelines provided in the [Translation process](https://github.com/opengisch/QField-docs?tab=readme-ov-file#translation-process).

## 6. Synchronization and Testing

- Translations are typically synchronized with the QField app's master codebase each day.
- To see your translation reflected in the app:
    - Join the [QField Beta Program](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/ch.opengis.qfield_dev)<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line --> for early access to new releases with these translations.

If your language is not yet available, we will happily add it for you.
Just open an issue on the GitHub repository and specify which language you would like to translate to.
