# Contributing to the Translation

Translations for the QField app are managed through the **Transifex** platform.

## 1. Access the Translation Platform

1. Go to the [OPENGIS Dashboard on Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/opengisch/).
2. Log in or create an account on Transifex.

## 2. Choose a Language to Contribute

1. Select a project you want to contribute to.
2. Select the language you want to contribute to.
3. Look for languages that need translation. These will have a "Translate" button next to them. Click on it.

## 4. Translate Strings

1. For each untranslated string:

    - Enter the equivalent translation in the "Type your translation here" field.
    - Ensure the translation is accurate and contextually appropriate.

2. Follow these important guidelines while translating:

    - **Preserve Cases**: Retain uppercase and lowercase letters as required.
    - **Preserve Reserved Words and Formatting**: Do not alter placeholders like `()`, `%1`, `<strong>`, or `<br>`.

## 5. Review Your Translation

- Confirm that the translation aligns with the guidelines provided in the [Translation process](https://github.com/opengisch/QField-docs?tab=readme-ov-file#translation-process).

## 6. Synchronisation and Testing

- Translations are typically synchronized with the QField app's master codebase each day.
- To see your translation reflected in the app:
    - Download the [QField Beta Application](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/ch.opengis.qfield_dev)<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->
    for early access to new releases with these translations.

If your language is not yet available, we will happily add it for you.
Just open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/opengisch/QField-docs/issues) and specify which language you would like to translate to.
