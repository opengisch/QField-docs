### **Active Users under Organization Plans**

An organization requires at least two users.
The total cost per billing cycle is defined by the number of **active** users.
An "active user" corresponds to a member who has performed at least one "job" within a project belonging to the organization during an invoice cycle.

To monitor the number of active users direct to *Organization Settings* > *Billing* > *Active users*
