# QFieldCloud Plans and Additional Storage

By default, when registering for QFieldCloud, you create a general user account with a free community plan.
With the free community plan, you can work by yourself on QGIS projects and apply changes as much as you like, as long as you do not exceed the 100 MB storage limit.
If you require more storage or want to work in a multi-user environment, you will have to upgrade to either:

- A personal **Pro Plan**  (Personal Plan)
- An **Organization Plan**  (Organizational Plan)

The same applies for additional data storage.

The billing information is necessary for both Pro and Organization plans and can be accessed through the **Billing section**  under your personal account settings OR the organization account settings.
Below is an overview of the different plans and what they include.
At any point you can modify your your plans according to your needs.

It is also possible to have a yearly subscription, where you will receive an annual invoice with a fixed amount of users and storage.
All pricing information is available <a href="https://qfield.cloud/pricing" target="_blank">on the Pricing page</a>.

!!! Warning

    1. If you have a **Personal Pro Account** and an **Organization Account** you will have **TWO separate pages** with billing information.

### **Active Users under Organization Plans**

An organization requires at least two users.
The total cost per billing cycle is defined by the number of **active** users.
An "active user" corresponds to a member who has performed at least one "job" within a project belonging to the organization during an invoice cycle.

To monitor the number of active users direct to *Organization Settings* > *Billing* > *Active users*
