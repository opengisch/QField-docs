# Sample projects

QField ships with three sample (demo) projects by default. You can use these projects to explore some of the QField configuration details in QGIS+QFieldSync.

The links below will download an archive with each project.

[Advanced Bee :material-bee-flower:](../assets/projects/advanced-bee-farming.zip){ .md-button }
[QField Users :material-map-marker:](../assets/projects/qfield-users-survey.zip){ .md-button }

You can also explore the sample projects directly in the [QField GitHub repository](https://github.com/opengisch/QField/tree/master/resources/sample_projects).
