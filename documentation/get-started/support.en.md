# Support

## Commercial Support

As developer of QField and QFieldCloud, [OPENGIS.ch](https://www.opengis.ch/#features)
provides [training packages](https://www.opengis.ch/qfield-training/)
and custom commercial [support and development contracts](https://www.opengis.ch/qgis-support/) with SLA.

### Development and Custom Apps

You probably have plenty of ideas for nice features that are not
implemented yet. Please [contact us](https://www.opengis.ch/#contact) to
discuss the best approach to integrate this idea into QField or to
create your own custom app.
