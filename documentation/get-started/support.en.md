## Commercial Support

As developer of QField and QFieldCloud, [OPENGIS.ch](https://www.opengis.ch/#features) <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->

and custom commercial [support and development contracts](https://www.opengis.ch/qgis-support/) with SLA. <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->

### Development and Custom Apps

implemented yet. Please [contact us](https://www.opengis.ch/#contact) to
discuss the best approach to integrate this idea into QField or to
create your own custom app.
