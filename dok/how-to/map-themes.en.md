# Configure Map Themes

The beautiful thing about GIS is that maps are dynamic. Layers can
individually be shown and hidden and information can be presented more
or less prominently based on the task at hand.

This is what *Map Themes* (before QGIS 3.0 known as *Visibility
Presets*) are for.

## Creating a Map Theme

Creating a Map Theme in QGIS is a very simple task.

1.  Style the map and layers to your requirements
2.  Save it as a named Map Theme
3.  Load the project on your device and change the active Map Theme

## Change the active Map Theme

Switching Map Themes is possible from the Dashboard.

Use the *Map Themes* combobox to chose the active theme.
