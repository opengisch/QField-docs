# Base maps and Imagery

QField is able to load a base map from a web service.

In QGIS with the plugin QFieldSync, set the base map to the "Project
Configuration"

!![sync_basemap](../assets/images/qfield-sync_basemap.png)

Then make the package of the project to load it on your device.

!![sync_package1](../assets/images/qfield-sync_package1.png)

!![sync_package2](../assets/images/qfield-sync_package2.png)

Below the result on QField.
